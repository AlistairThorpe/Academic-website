However, the median age of laboratory-confirmed cases is about 45 years and age is not a sole potential risk for catching COVID-19; unfortunately, some social media pretend that elderly people are more likely to be infected by COVID-19. Providing such information about the COVID-19 can increase the stress and anxiety among the elderly that may weaken their immune system. It is suggested that social media provide appropriate information to reduce public stress.},

We contend that unintended negative outcomes can result from fear appeals that intensify the already complex pandemic and efforts to contain it. We encourage public health professionals to reevaluate their desire to use fear appeals in COVID-19 health communication and recommend that evidence-based health communication be utilized to address the needs of a specific community, help people understand what they are being asked to do, explain step-by-step how to complete preventative behaviors, and consider external factors needed to support the uptake of behaviors. To aid health professionals in redirecting away from the use of fear appeals, we offer a phased approach to creating health communication messages during the COVID-19 crisis.},

	abstract = {This rapid, narrative review summarizes useful evidence from behavioral science for fighting the COVID-19 outbreak. We undertook an extensive, multi-disciplinary literature search covering five issues: handwashing, face touching, self-isolation, public-spirited behavior, and responses to crisis communication. The search identified more than 100 relevant papers. We find effective behavioral interventions to increase handwashing, but not to reduce face touching. Social supports and behavioral plans can reduce the negative psychological effects of isolation, potentially reducing the disincentive to isolate. Public-spirited behavior is more likely with frequent communication of what is “best for all”, strong group identity, and social disapproval of noncompliance. Effective crisis communication involves speed, honesty, credibility, empathy, and promoting useful individual actions. Risks are probably best communicated through numbers, with ranges to describe uncertainty – simply stating a maximum may bias public perception. The findings aim to be useful not only for government and public health authorities, but for organizations and communities.},

	abstract = {Ageism is a widespread phenomenon and constitutes a significant threat to older people’s well-being. Identifying the factors contributing to ageism is critical to inform policies that minimise its societal impact. In this systematic review, we gathered and summarised empirical studies exploring the key determinants of ageism against older people for a period of over forty years (1970-2017). A comprehensive search using fourteen databases identified all published records related to the umbrella concept of “ageism”. Reviewers independently screened the final pool to identify all papers focusing on determinants, according to a predefined list of inclusion and exclusion criteria. All relevant information was extracted and summarised following a narrative synthesis approach. 199 papers were included in this review. We identified a total of 14 determinants as robustly associated with ageism. Of these, 13 have an effect on other-directed ageism, and one on self-directed ageism. The quality of contact with older people and the positive or negative presentation of older people to others emerged as the most robust determinants of other-directed ageism; self-directed ageism is mostly determined by older adults’ health status. Given the correlational nature of most studies included in this review, inferences on causality should be made cautiously.},

As such, ST effects are detectable by means of multigroup confirmatory factor analysis. This enables research into the generalizability of ST effects to real-life or high-stakes testing. The modeling approach is described in detail and applied to 3 experiments in which the amount of ST for minorities and women was manipulated. Results indicate that ST results in measurement bias of intelligence and mathematics tests.},

This theory has immense theoretical and practical implications, but many studies supporting it include small samples and varying operational definitions of “stereotype threat”. We address the first challenge by leveraging a network of psychology labs to recruit a large Black student sample (Nanticipated = 2700) from multiple US sites (Nanticipated = 27). We address the second challenge by identifying three threat-increasing and three threat-decreasing procedures that could plausibly affect performance and use an adaptive Bayesian design to determine which “stereotype threat” operationalization yields the strongest evidence for underperformance. This project has the potential to advance our knowledge of a scientifically and socially important topic: whether and under what conditions stereotype threat affects current US Black students.},

	abstract = {Background: Graphics are increasingly used to represent the spread of infectious diseases (e.g., inﬂuenza, Zika, Ebola); however, the impact of using graphics to adequately inform the general population is unknown.
Objective: To examine whether three ways of visually presenting data (heat map, dot map, or pictotrendline)—all depicting the same information regarding the spread of a hypothetical outbreak of inﬂuenza—inﬂuence intent to vaccinate, risk perception, and knowledge. Design: Survey with participants randomized to receive a simulated news article accompanied by one of the three graphics that communicated prevalence of inﬂuenza and number of inﬂuenza-related deaths. Setting: International online survey. Participants: 16,510 adults living in 11 countries selected using stratiﬁed random sampling based on age and gender.
Measurements: After reading the article and viewing the presented graphic, participants completed a survey that measured interest in vaccination, perceived risk of contracting disease, knowledge gained, interest in additional information about the disease, and perception of the graphic.
Results: Heat maps and picto-trendlines were evaluated more positively than dot maps. Heat maps were more effective than picto-trendlines and no different from dot maps at increasing interest in vaccination, perceived risk of contracting disease, and interest in additional information about the disease. Heat maps and picto-trendlines were more successful at conveying knowledge than dot maps. Overall, heat maps were the only graphic to be superior in every outcome. Limitations: Results are based on a hypothetical scenario.
Conclusion: Heat maps are a viable option to promote interest in and concern about infectious diseases. Ó 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

These noncompliance behaviors partly reflect people’s concerns for the inherent costs of social distancing while discounting its public health benefits. We propose that this oversight may be associated with the limitation in one’s mental capacity to simultaneously retain multiple pieces of information in working memory (WM) for rational decision making that leads to social-distancing compliance. We tested this hypothesis in 850 United States residents during the first 2 wk following the presidential declaration of national emergency because of the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that participants’ social-distancing compliance at this initial stage could be predicted by individual differences in WM capacity, partly due to increased awareness of benefits over costs of social distancing among higher WM capacity individuals. Critically, the unique contribution of WM capacity to the individual differences in social-distancing compliance could not be explained by other psychological and socioeconomic factors (e.g., moods, personality, education, and income levels). Furthermore, the critical role of WM capacity in social-distancing compliance can be generalized to the compliance with another set of rules for social interactions, namely the fairness norm, in Western cultures. Collectively, our data reveal contributions of a core cognitive process underlying social-distancing compliance during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting a potential cognitive venue for developing strategies to mitigate a public health crisis.},

            A number of important principles in effective risk communication established in the late 20th century can provide important scientific insight into patient response to the risks posed by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Early risk communication scholars found acceptability of risk was shaped by 2 key components: hazard and outrage. The number of people who are exposed, infected, and fall ill can be considered the hazard. How the public and patients and respond to messages regarding risk mitigation relates to outrage. Social and cultural factors, immediacy, uncertainty, familiarity, personal control, scientific uncertainty, and trust in institutions and media all shape perception and response to risk mesaging. Outrage factors influence the ever-changing public understanding of COVID-19 risk. In concert, hazard and outrage along with cultural and economic context shape adherence to, and overall acceptance of, personal mitigation strategies including wearing facemasks and social distancing among the general public. The spread of misinformation on social media also provides both challenges and opportunities for clinicians. Social media offers an opportunity for experts to quickly convey true information about hazards, but offers others the opportunity to counter this with the spread of misinformation and exacerbate outrage. We propose strategies for infectious diseases clinicians to apply risk communication principles and frameworks to improve patient care and public message development in response to COVID-19.},

	abstract = {Many incentives are monetary, and when private or public institutions seek to change behavior, it is natural to change monetary incentives. But many other incentives are a product of social meanings, about which people may not much deliberate, but which can operate as subsidies or as taxes. In some times and places, for example, the social meaning of smoking has been positive, increasing the incentive to smoke; in other times and places, it has been negative, and thus served to reduce smoking. With respect to safety and health, including the wearing of masks to avoid health risks, social meanings change radically over time, and they can be dramatically different in one place from what they are in another. Often people live in accordance with meanings that they deplore, or at least wish were otherwise. But it is exceptionally difﬁcult for individuals to alter meanings on their own. Alteration of meanings can come from law, which may, through a mandate, transform the meaning of action into a bland, “I comply with law,” or into a less bland, “I am a good citizen.” Alteration of social meanings can also come from large-scale private action, engineered or promoted by “meaning entrepreneurs,” who can turn the meaning of action from, “I am an oddball,” to, “I do my civic duty,” or, “I protect others from harm.” Sometimes subgroups rebel against new or altered meanings, produced by law or meaning entrepreneurs, but often those meanings stick and produce signiﬁcant change.},

	abstract = {Background: Do young adults have low compliance rates with public health measures aimed at curbing the spread of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)? This paper leverages a prospective-longitudinal cohort study with data before and during the pandemic to examine this question.Methods: Data came from an ongoing cohort study (n=737). Non-compliance with public health measures and concurrent correlates were measured at age 22. Antecedent sociodemographic, social, and psychological factors were measured at ages 15-20.Findings: Young adults generally complied with COVID-19 public health measures, although compliance with some measures (e.g., cleaning/disinfecting mobile phones, standing 1.5-2 meters apart) was relatively lower. Non-compliance, especially with hygiene-related measures, was more prevalent in males, and in individuals with higher education, higher SES, and a non- migrant background. Non-compliance was associated with “antisocial potential,” including pre-pandemic low acceptance of moral rules, legal cynicism, low shame/guilt, low self-control, engagement in delinquent behaviors, and association with delinquent peers. Young adults with low trust, including in the government’s measures for fighting the virus, also complied less.Interpretation: In order to increase voluntary compliance with COVID-19 measures, public health campaigns should implement strategies that foster moral obligation and trust in authorities, or leverage trustworthy individuals in the community to disseminate information. For young adults with low self-control, self-monitoring, environmental restructuring, or nudging may increase compliance. Long-term investments into integrating antisocial youth into society may decrease rule-breaking behaviors, including during pandemics when compliance saves lives.},

We undertook an extensive, multi-disciplinary literature search covering five issues: handwashing, face touching, self-isolation, public-spirited behavior, and responses to crisis communication. The search identified more than 100 relevant papers. We find effective behavioral interventions to increase handwashing, but not to reduce face touching. Social supports and behavioral plans can reduce the negative psychological effects of isolation, potentially reducing the disincentive to isolate. Public-spirited behavior is more likely with frequent communication of what is “best for all”, strong group identity, and social disapproval of noncompliance. Effective crisis communication involves speed, honesty, credibility, empathy, and promoting useful individual actions. Risks are probably best communicated through numbers, with ranges to describe uncertainty – simply stating a maximum may bias public perception. The findings aim to be useful not only for government and public health authorities, but for organizations and communities.},

	abstract = {Naming a contagious disease, such as COVID-19, by the geographic locality where the disease originates or starts, for example, Wuhan or China, may stigmatize speciﬁc ethnic groups related to that locality, and such stigmatizing behavior will further lead to legitimized discrimination, prejudice, and group conﬂicts. However, as the construction of social stigma relates closely to group identities, creating xenophobia through stigmatizing out-group members may increase in-group solidarity, which can be taken as a political strategy for the government to avoid the blame from citizens. In this study, we experimentally examine: (1) whether labeling COVID-19 as “Chinese Virus” will result in increased stigmatization and xenophobia against Chinese immigrants; (2) whether the “Chinese Virus” label will reduce people’s perceived blameworthiness of the federal government. Our results (N = 1, 200) show that about 16\% of participants located in the U.S. indicated xenophobia against Chinese immigrants, and perceived blameworthiness of the federal government was polarized as expected. Further, although stigmatization was not signiﬁcantly triggered by the “Chinese Virus” label in full sample, we do ﬁnd statistically signiﬁcant treatment eﬀects in multiple political and demographic subgroups (21.47\% increase in Democrats, 16.73\% in Liberals, and 19.93\% in Whites, no eﬀect in conservatives and Republicans while the stigmatization remains at higher levels than other groups). Meanwhile, our list experiment strategy detected no social desirability bias when measuring xenophobia, suggesting that stigmatizing Chinese immigrants was not suppressed by current social norms. However, increased stigmatization did not lead to the reduce of blameworthiness of the federal government in handling the current pandemic.},

	abstract = {Across two studies with over 1,600 U.S. adults recruited online, we present evidence that people share false claims about COVID-19 partly because they simply fail to think sufficiently about whether or not content is accurate when deciding what to share. In Study 1, participants were far worse at discerning between true and false content when deciding what they would share on social media relative to when they are asked directly about accuracy. Furthermore, cognitive reflection and science knowledge were associated with stronger discernment. In Study 2, we found that a simple accuracy reminder at the beginning of the study – i.e., judging the accuracy of a nonCOVID-19-related headline – more than doubled the level of truth discernment in participants’ sharing intentions. Our results, which mirror those found previously for political fake news, suggest that nudging people to think about accuracy is a simple way to improve choices about what to share on social media.},

We address the first challenge by leveraging a network of psychology labs to recruit a large Black student sample (Nanticipated = 2700) from multiple US sites (Nanticipated = 27). We address the second challenge by identifying three threat-increasing and three threat-decreasing procedures that could plausibly affect performance and use an adaptive Bayesian design to determine which “stereotype threat” operationalization yields the strongest evidence for underperformance. This project has the potential to advance our knowledge of a scientifically and socially important topic: whether and under what conditions stereotype threat affects current US Black students.},

They then completed self-report measures of anxious arousal as well as subtle and blatant prejudice towards Chinese people. As expected, participants in the threat (vs. control) condition reported greater anxious arousal which, in turn, predicted greater subtle and blatant prejudice. Threat (vs. control) condition also indirectly predicted greater subtle and blatant prejudice via greater anxious arousal.

Currently, if climate change enters the arena of public debate, it primarily does so in direct relation to the pandemic. In two experiments, we investigated (1) whether portraying the response to the COVID-19 threat as a “trial run” for future climate action would increase climate-change concern and mitigation support, and (2) whether portraying climate change as a concern that needs to take a “back seat” while focus lies on economic recovery would decrease climate-change concern and mitigation support. We found no support for the effectiveness of a trial-run frame in either experiment. In Experiment 1, we found that a back-seat frame reduced participants’ support for mitigative action. In Experiment 2, the back-seat framing reduced both climatechange concern and mitigation support; a combined inoculation and refutation was able to offset the drop in climate concern but not the reduction in mitigation support.},

	abstract = {Background: Antibiotic resistance is a growing threat to public health. Despite various attempts at educating the public on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and judicial antibiotic use, fallacies and misconceptions remain. To successfully promote behavior change, various cognitive constructs pertaining to antibiotic behavior need to be identiﬁed and targeted.
Methods: Using the Arksey and O’Malley (2005) methodological framework, a credible reﬂexive examination of literature was conducted, permitting identiﬁcation of a breadth of literature that pertained to the inﬂuence of cognitive constructs on public antimicrobial behavior.
Results: From 393 abstracts identiﬁed, 67 full articles were screened, and 43 papers were chosen for review. Three themes were identiﬁed (1) sociodemographic inﬂuences; (2) knowledge, misconceptions, and fallacies; and (3) public attitudes and the social inﬂuence of friends and family. Geographical location, education level, cognitive dissonance, and social norms were found to inﬂuence AMR cognition, resulting in disproportionate risk assessments that are facilitated by social information brokering.
Conclusions: Public AMR resilience, responsibility, and behavior compliance are inﬂuenced by cognitive constructs, which are liable to the appropriation of misconceptions, fallacies, and social behavior models obtained via information brokering. A cohesive multidisciplinary participatory approach to AMR management and interventional design that applies the inﬂuence of cognitive constructs to inform public AMR behavior compliance is recommended.},

Strikingly, up to half of ICU patients receiving empirical antibiotic therapy have no definitively confirmed infection, while de-escalation and shortened treatment duration are insufficiently considered in those with documented sepsis, highlighting the potential benefit of implementing antibiotic stewardship programs (ASP) and other quality improvement initiatives. The objective of this narrative review is to summarize the available evidence, emerging options, and unsolved controversies for the optimization of antibiotic therapy in the ICU. Published data notably support the need for better identification of patients at risk of MDRB infection, more accurate diagnostic tools enabling a rule-in/rule-out approach for bacte‑rial sepsis, an individualized reasoning for the selection of single-drug or combination empirical regimen, the use of adequate dosing and administration schemes to ensure the attainment of pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics targets, concomitant source control when appropriate, and a systematic reappraisal of initial therapy in an attempt to minimize collateral damage on commensal ecosystems through de-escalation and treatment-shortening whenever conceivable. This narrative review also aims at compiling arguments for the elaboration of actionable ASP in the ICU, including improved patient outcomes and a reduction in antibiotic-related selection pressure that may help to con‑trol the dissemination of MDRB in this healthcare setting.},

	abstract = {Antibiotic de-escalation is an appealing strategy in antibiotic stewardship programmes. We aimed to assess its safety and effects using a systematic review and meta-analysis. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies assessing adults with bacteraemia, microbiologically documented pneumonia or severe sepsis, comparing between antibiotic de-escalation and no deescalation. De-escalation was deﬁned as changing an initially covering antibiotic regimen to a narrower spectrum regimen based on antibiotic susceptibility testing results within 96 hours. The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality. A search of published articles and conference proceedings was last updated in September 2015. Crude and adjusted ORs with 95\% CI were pooled in random-effects meta-analyses. Sixteen observational studies and three RCTs were included. Risk of bias related to confounding was high in the observational studies. De-escalation was associated with fewer deaths in the unadjusted analysis (OR 0.53, 95\% CI 0.39e0.73), 19 studies, moderate heterogeneity. In the adjusted analysis there was no signiﬁcant difference in mortality (adjusted OR 0.83, 95\% CI 0.59e1.16), 11 studies, moderate heterogeneity and the RCTs showed non-signiﬁcant increased mortality with de-escalation (OR 1.73, 95\% 0.97e3.06), three trials, no heterogeneity. There was a signiﬁcant unadjusted association between de-escalation and survival in bacteraemia/severe sepsis (OR 0.45, 95\% CI 0.30e0.67) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (OR 0.49, 95\% CI 0.26e0.95), but not with other pneumonia (OR 0.97, 95\% CI 0.45e2.12). Only two studies reported on the emergence of resistance with inconsistent ﬁndings. Observational studies suggest lower mortality with antibiotic susceptibility testing-based de-escalation for bacteraemia, severe sepsis and ventilator-associated pneumonia that was not demonstrated in RCTs.

	abstract = {Objectives: To understand clinicians’ impressions of and decision-making processes regarding an informatics-supported antibiotic timeout program to re-evaluate the appropriateness of continuing vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam.
Methods: We implemented a multi-pronged informatics intervention, based on Dual Process Theory, to prompt discontinuation of unwarranted vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam on or after day three in a large Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Two workﬂow changes were introduced to facilitate cognitive deliberation about continuing antibiotics at day three: (1) teams completed an electronic template note, and (2) a paper summary of clinical and antibiotic-related information was provided to clinical teams. Shortly after starting the intervention, six focus groups were conducted with users or potential users. Interviews were recorded and transcribed. Iterative thematic analysis identiﬁed recurrent themes from feedback.
Results: Themes that emerged are represented by the following quotations: (1) captures and controls attention (‘‘it reminds us to think about it”), (2) enhances informed and deliberative reasoning (‘‘it makes you think twice”), (3) redirects decision direction (‘‘. . .because [there was no indication] I just [discontinued] it without even trying”), (4) fosters autonomy and improves team empowerment (‘‘the template. . . forces the team to really discuss it”), and (5) limits use of emotion-based heuristics (‘‘my clinical concern is high enough I think they need more aggressive therapy. . .”).
Conclusions: Requiring template completion to continue antibiotics nudged clinicians to re-assess the appropriateness of speciﬁed antibiotics. Antibiotic timeouts can encourage deliberation on overprescribed antibiotics without substantially curtailing autonomy. An effective nudge should take into account clinician’s time, workﬂow, and thought processes.},

Hitherto research has almost exclusively focused on doctors’ prescribing, with nurses’ roles in antibiotic use remaining virtually invisible. Drawing on interviews with 30 nurses, we focus on nurses as brokers of doctors’ antibiotic decisions, nursing capacity to challenge doctors’ decisions, and, “back stage” strategies for circumnavigating organizational constraints. We argue that nurses occupy an essential and conscious position as brokers within the hospital; a subject position that is not neutral, facilitates (short-term) cohesion, and involves the pursuit of particular (preferred) nursing outcomes. Illustrating how authority can be diffuse, mediated by institutionalized praxis, and how professionals evade attempts to govern their practice, we challenge the reification of physician prescribing power, arguing that it may work against the utilization of nurses as important stakeholders in the future of antibiotics.},

	abstract = {Introduction: A rational use of antibiotics is of paramount importance in order to prevent the emergence of multidrug resistant bacteria that can lead to therapeutic impasse, especially in intensive care units (ICUs). A de-escalation strategy is therefore naturally advocated as part of better antibiotics usage. However, the clinical impact of such a strategy has not been widely studied. We aimed to assess the feasibility and the clinical impact of a de-escalation strategy in a medical ICU and to identify factors associated when de-escalation was possible.
Methods: We performed a retrospective study of patients hospitalized in a medical ICU over a period of six months. Independent factors associated with de-escalation and its clinical impact were assessed.
Results: Two hundred and twenty-nine patients were included in the study. Antibiotics were de-escalated in 117 patients (51\%). The appropriateness of initial antibiotic therapy was the only independent factor associated with the performance of de-escalation (OR = 2.9, 95\% CI, 1.5-5.7; P = 0.002). By contrast, inadequacy of initial antibiotic therapy (OR = 0.1, 0.0 to 0.1, P {\textless}0.001) and the presence of multidrug resistant bacteria (OR = 0.2, 0.1 to 0.7, P = 0.006) prevented from de-escalation. There were no differences in terms of short (ICU) or long-term (at 1 year) mortality rates or any secondary criteria such as ICU length of stay, duration of antibiotic therapy, mechanical ventilation, incidence of ICU-acquired infection, or multi-drug resistant bacteria emergence.
Conclusions: De-escalation appears feasible in most cases without any obvious negative clinical impact in a medical ICU.},

	abstract = {Background. There is limited knowledge of the key determinants of antimicrobial prescribing behavior (APB) in hospitals. An understanding of these determinants is required for the successful design, adoption, and implementation of quality improvement interventions in antimicrobial stewardship programs.
Methods. Qualitative semistructured interviews were conducted with doctors (n = 10), pharmacists (n = 10), and nurses and midwives (n = 19) in 4 hospitals in London. Interviews were conducted until thematic saturation was reached. Thematic analysis was applied to the data to identify the key determinants of antimicrobial prescribing behaviors.
Results. The APB of healthcare professionals is governed by a set of cultural rules. Antimicrobial prescribing is performed in an environment where the behavior of clinical leaders or seniors inﬂuences practice of junior doctors. Senior doctors consider themselves exempt from following policy and practice within a culture of perceived autonomous decision making that relies more on personal knowledge and experience than formal policy. Prescribers identify with the clinical groups in which they work and adjust their APB according to the prevailing practice within these groups. A culture of “noninterference” in the antimicrobial prescribing practice of peers prevents intervention into prescribing of colleagues. These sets of cultural rules demonstrate the existence of a “prescribing etiquette,” which dominates the APB of healthcare professionals. Prescribing etiquette creates an environment in which professional hierarchy and clinical groups act as key determinants of APB.
Conclusions. To inﬂuence the antimicrobial prescribing of individual healthcare professionals, interventions need to address prescribing etiquette and use clinical leadership within existing clinical groups to inﬂuence practice.},

	abstract = {Background.  Cultural and social determinants influence antibiotic decision-making in hospitals. We investigated and compared cultural determinants of antibiotic decision-making in acute medical and surgical specialties.
Methods.  An ethnographic observational study of antibiotic decision-making in acute medical and surgical teams at a London teaching hospital was conducted (August 2015–May 2017). Data collection included 500 hours of direct observations, and face-toface interviews with 23 key informants. A grounded theory approach, aided by Nvivo 11 software, analyzed the emerging themes. An iterative and recursive process of analysis ensured saturation of the themes. The multiple modes of enquiry enabled cross-validation and triangulation of the findings.
Results.  In medicine, accepted norms of the decision-making process are characterized as collectivist (input from pharmacists, infectious disease, and medical microbiology teams), rationalized, and policy-informed, with emphasis on de-escalation of therapy. The gaps in antibiotic decision-making in acute medicine occur chiefly in the transition between the emergency department and inpatient teams, where ownership of the antibiotic prescription is lost. In surgery, team priorities are split between 3 settings: operating room, outpatient clinic, and ward. Senior surgeons are often absent from the ward, leaving junior staff to make complex medical decisions. This results in defensive antibiotic decision-making, leading to prolonged and inappropriate antibiotic use.
Conclusions.  In medicine, the legacy of infection diagnosis made in the emergency department determines antibiotic decision-making. In surgery, antibiotic decision-making is perceived as a nonsurgical intervention that can be delegated to junior staff or other specialties. Different, bespoke approaches to optimize antibiotic prescribing are therefore needed to address these specific challenges.},

	abstract = {Objectives: To evaluate the current state of evidence for antimicrobial stewardship interventions in the critical care unit.
Methods: We performed a systematic search of OVID MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane electronic databases from 1996–2010. Studies were included if they involved any experimental intervention to improve antimicrobial utilization in the critical care setting.
Results: Thirty-eight studies met the inclusion criteria, of which 24 met our quality inclusion criteria. The quality of research was poor, with only 3 randomized controlled trials, 3 interrupted time series and 18 (75\%) uncontrolled before-and-after studies. We identiﬁed six intervention types: studies of antibiotic restriction or preapproval (six studies); formal infectious diseases physician consultation (ﬁve); implementation of guidelines or protocols for de-escalation (two); guidelines for antibiotic prophylaxis or treatment in intensive care (two); formal reassessment of antibiotics on a pre-speciﬁed day of therapy (three); and implementation of computer-assisted decision support (six). Stewardship interventions were associated with reductions in antimicrobial utilization (11\%–38\% deﬁned daily doses/1000 patient-days), lower total antimicrobial costs (US\$ 5 –10/ patient-day), shorter average duration of antibiotic therapy, less inappropriate use and fewer antibiotic adverse events. Stewardship interventions beyond 6 months were associated with reductions in antimicrobial resistance rates, although this differed by drug –pathogen combination. Antibiotic stewardship was not associated with increases in nosocomial infection rates, length of stay or mortality.
Conclusions: More rigorous research is needed, but available evidence suggests that antimicrobial stewardship is associated with improved antimicrobial utilization in the intensive care unit, with corresponding improvements in antimicrobial resistance and adverse events, and without compromise of short-term clinical outcomes.},

Results  Key facilitators of antibiotic stewardship (AS) at the hospital included a dedicated committee overseeing appropriate inpatient antibiotic use, a prompt microbiology laboratory, a high level of AS understanding among staff, established guidelines for empiric prescribing and an easily accessible antibiogram. We identified the following barriers: limited access to clinical pharmacists, physician immunity to change regarding stewardship policies, infrequent antibiotic de-escalation, high physician workload, an incomplete electronic medical record (EMR), inadequate AS programme (ASP) physical visibility and high antibiotic use in the community.
Conclusions  Opportunities for improvement at this institution include increasing accessibility to clinical pharmacists, implementing strategies to overcome physician immunity to change and establishing a more accessible and complete EMR.

	abstract = {Objective To determine whether 8 days is as effective as 15 days of antibiotic treatment of patients with microbiologically proven VAP. Design, Setting, and Participants Prospective, randomized, double-blind (until day 8) clinical trial conducted in 51 French ICUs. A total of 401 patients diagnosed as having developed VAP by quantitative culture results of bronchoscopic specimens and who had received initial appropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy were enrolled between May 1999 and June 2002. Intervention A total of 197 patients were randomly assigned to receive 8 days and 204 to receive 15 days of therapy with an antibiotic regimen selected by the treating physician. Main Outcome Measures Primary outcome measures—death from any cause, microbiologically documented pulmonary infection recurrence, and antibiotic-free days—were assessed 28 days after VAP onset and analyzed on an intent-to-treat basis.
Results Compared with patients treated for 15 days, those treated for 8 days had neither excess mortality (18.8\% vs 17.2\%; difference, 1.6\%; 90\% confidence interval [CI], −3.7\% to 6.9\%) nor more recurrent infections (28.9\% vs 26.0\%; difference, 2.9\%; 90\% CI, −3.2\% to 9.1\%), but they had more mean (SD) antibiotic-free days (13.1 [7.4] vs 8.7 [5.2] days, PϽ.001). The number of mechanical ventilation–free days, the number of organ failure–free days, the length of ICU stay, and mortality rates on day 60 for the 2 groups did not differ. Although patients with VAP caused by nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, did not have more unfavorable outcomes when antimicrobial therapy lasted only 8 days, they did have a higher pulmonary infection-recurrence rate compared with those receiving 15 days of treatment (40.6\% vs 25.4\%; difference, 15.2\%, 90\% CI, 3.9\%-26.6\%). Among patients who developed recurrent infections, multiresistant pathogens emerged less frequently in those who had received 8 days of antibiotics (42.1\% vs 62.0\% of pulmonary recurrences, P=.04).
Conclusions Among patients who had received appropriate initial empirical therapy, with the possible exception of those developing nonfermenting gram-negative bacillus infections, comparable clinical effectiveness against VAP was obtained with the 8- and 15-day treatment regimens. The 8-day group had less antibiotic use.},

RESULTS: Participants were receptive to guidelines and believed they were useful. However, participants’ responses to the case vignettes demonstrated that IDSA guideline recommendations were not routinely followed for SSTI, HAP, and ASB. We identiﬁed 3 barriers to guideline-concordant care: (1) physicians’ lack of awareness of speciﬁc guideline recommendations; (2) tension between adhering to guidelines and the desire to individualize patient care; and (3) skepticism of certain guideline recommendations.
CONCLUSIONS: Case vignettes may be useful tools to assess physician knowledge and acceptance of antibioticprescribing guidelines. Using case vignettes, we identiﬁed 3 barriers to following IDSA guidelines. Efforts to improve guideline-concordant antibiotic prescribing should focus on reducing such barriers at the local level.

	abstract = {Background: Antimicrobial resistance is a global health threat, partly driven by inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions for acute medical patients in hospitals. Aim: To provide a systematic review of qualitative research on antibiotic prescribing decisions in hospitals worldwide, including broad-spectrum antibiotic use.
Methods: A systematic search of qualitative research on antibiotic prescribing for adult hospital patients published between 2007 and 2017 was conducted. Drawing on the Health Belief Model, a framework synthesis was conducted to assess threat perceptions associated with antimicrobial resistance, and perceived beneﬁts and barriers associated with antibiotic stewardship. Findings: The risk of antimicrobial resistance was generally perceived to be serious, but the abstract and long-term nature of its consequences led physicians to doubt personal susceptibility. While prescribers believed in the beneﬁts of optimizing prescribing, the direct link between over-prescribing and antimicrobial resistance was questioned, and prescribers’ behaviour change was frequently considered futile when ﬁghting the complex problem of antimicrobial resistance. The salience of individual patient risks was a key barrier to more conservative prescribing. Physicians perceived broad-spectrum antibiotics to be effective and low risk; prescribing broad-spectrum antibiotics involved low cognitive demand and enabled physicians to manage patient expectations. Antibiotic prescribing decisions in low-income countries were shaped by a context of heightened uncertainty and risk due to poor microbiology and infection control services.
Conclusions: When tackling antimicrobial resistance, the tensions between immediate individual risks and long-term collective risks need to be taken into account. Efforts to reduce diagnostic uncertainty and to change risk perceptions will be critical in shifting practice.},

	abstract = {Objective. To implement and evaluate the effect of a computerized decision support tool on antibiotic use in an intensive care unit (ICU). Design. Prospective before-and-after cohort study. Setting. Twenty-four bed tertiary hospital adult medical/surgical ICU. Participants. All consecutive patients from May 2001 to November 2001 (N = 524) and March 2002 to September 2002 (N = 536). Intervention. A real-time microbiology browser and computerized decision support system for isolate directed antibiotic prescription. Main outcome measures. Number of courses of antibiotic prescribed, antibiotic utilization (defined daily doses (DDDs)/100 ICU bed-days), antibiotic susceptibility mismatches, and system uptake.
Results. There was a significant reduction in the proportion of patients prescribed carbapenems [odds ratio (OR) = 0.61, 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 0.39–0.97, P = 0.04], third-generation cephalosporins (OR = 0.58, 95\% CI = 0.42–0.79, P = 0.001), and vancomycin (OR = 0.67, 95\% CI = 0.45–1.00, P = 0.05) after adjustment for risk factors including Apache II score, suspected infection, positive microbiology, intubation, and length of stay. The decision support tool was associated with a 10.5\% reduction in both total antibiotic utilization (166–149 DDDs/100 ICU bed days) and the highest volume broad-spectrum antibiotics. There were fewer susceptibility mismatches for initial antibiotic therapy (OR = 0.63, 95\% CI = 0.39–0.98, P = 0.02) and increased de-escalation to narrower spectrum antibiotics. Uptake of the program was high with 6028 access episodes during the 6-month evaluation period.
Conclusions. This tool streamlined collation and clinical use of microbiology results and integrated into the daily ICU workflow. Its introduction was accompanied by a reduction in both total and broad-spectrum antibiotic use and an increase in the number of switches to narrower spectrum antibiotics.},

	abstract = {Background: Misuse of antibiotics can lead to the development of antibiotic resistance, which adversely affects morbidity, mortality, length of stay, and cost. To combat the threat of antimicrobial resistance, The Joint Commission and the Centers for Medicare \& Medicaid Services have initiated or proposed requirements for hospitals to have antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs), but implementation remains challenging. A key-informant interview study was conducted to describe the characteristics and innovative strategies of leading ASPs.
Methods: Semistructured interviews were conducted with 12 program leaders at four ASPs in the United States, chosen by purposive sampling on the basis of national reputation, scholarship, and geography. Questions focused on ASP implementation, program structure, strengths, weaknesses, lessons learned, and future directions. Content analysis was used to identify dominant themes.
Results: Three major themes were identiﬁed. The ﬁrst was evolution of ASPs from a top-down structure to a more diffuse approach involving unit-based pharmacists, multidisciplinary staff, and shared responsibility for antimicrobial prescribing under the ASPs’ leadership. The second theme was integration of information technology (IT) systems, which enabled realtime interventions to optimize antimicrobial therapy and patient management. The third was barriers to technology integration, including limited resources for data analysis and poor interoperability between software systems.
Conclusion: The study provides valuable insights on program implementation at a sample of leading ASPs across the United States. These ASPs used expansion of personnel to amplify the ASP’s impact and integrated IT resources into daily work ﬂow to improve efficiency. These ﬁndings can be used to guide implementation at other hospitals and aid in future policy development.},

	abstract = {Background: The inappropriate use of antimicrobials drives antimicrobial resistance. We conducted a study to map physician decision-making processes for acute infection management in secondary care to identify potential targets for quality improvement interventions.
Methods: Physicians newly qualified to consultant level participated in semi-structured interviews. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim for analysis using NVIVO11.0 software. Grounded theory methodology was applied. Analytical categories were created using constant comparison approach to the data and participants were recruited to the study until thematic saturation was reached.
Results: Twenty physicians were interviewed. The decision pathway for the management of acute infections follows a Bayesian-like step-wise approach, with information processed and systematically added to prior assumptions to guide management. The main emerging themes identified as determinants of the decision-making of individual physicians were (1) perceptions of providing ‘optimal’ care for the patient with infection by providing rapid and often intravenous therapy; (2) perceptions that stopping/de-escalating therapy was a senior doctor decision with junior trainees not expected to contribute; and (3) expectation of interactions with local guidelines and microbiology service advice. Feedback on review of junior doctor prescribing decisions was often lacking, causing frustration and confusion on appropriate practice within this cohort.
Conclusion: Interventions to improve infection management must incorporate mechanisms to promote distribution of responsibility for decisions made. The disparity between expectations of prescribers to start but not review/stop therapy must be urgently addressed with mechanisms to improve communication and feedback to junior prescribers to facilitate their continued development as prudent antimicrobial prescribers.},

We aimed to (a) provide missing causal evidence of this effect, (b) identify whether the expectations distort the perceived probability of a bacterial infection either in a preor postdecisional distortions pathway, and (c) detect possible moderators of this effect. Method: Family physicians expressed their willingness to prescribe antibiotics (Experiment 1, n1 ϭ 305) or their decision to prescribe (Experiment 2, n2 ϭ 131) and assessed the probability of a bacterial infection in hypothetical patients with infections either with low or high expectations for antibiotics. Response order of prescribing/probability was manipulated in Experiment 1. Results: Overall, the expectations for antibiotics increased intention to prescribe (Experiment 1, F(1, 301) ϭ 25.32, p Ͻ .001, ␩2p ϭ .08, regardless of the response order; Experiment 2, odds ratio [OR] ϭ 2.31, and OR ϭ 0.75, Vignettes 1 and 2, respectively).

Physicians’ experience was positively associated with prescribing, but it did not moderate the expectations effect on prescribing. Conclusions: Patients’ and their parents’ expectations increase antibiotics prescribing, but their effect is localized—it does not leak into the perceived probability of a bacterial infection.

On the basis of this scenario, we conducted three experiments with the aim of understanding how best to help lay people understand these data and the practical goal of improving the public presentation of these data. The experiments compared different outcome measures for displaying the survival rate (percentage scale versus the ratio of the predicted/observed rates) and presentation formats (individual hospital versus all hospitals shown) for outcomes data presented relative to prediction intervals generated by a risk model that adjusts for case mix. Our data highlight how easily inappropriate comparisons can inﬂuence evaluations of complex data: for instance, both a survival ratio of 1 and the presence of other hospitals seemingly provided reference points that resulted in inappropriately harsh evaluations of some hospitals. By drawing on evaluability theory, we demonstrate how to enhance people’s understanding of these complex data while also discouraging inappropriate comparisons, which has implications for communicating risk and uncertainty and for choice architecture design in a range of contexts.

Clinicians perceived 840 (31.3\%) as wanting to be prescribed antibiotics (McNemar’s test, p,0.05). Their perception agreed modestly with the three patient views (Kappa’s = 0.29, 0.32 and 0.21, PA’s = 0.56, 0.56 and 0.33, NA’s = 0.72, 0.75 and 0.82, respectively). 1,464 (54.4\%) patients were prescribed antibiotics. Illness presentation and resolution were similar for patients regardless their views. These associations were not modified by antibiotic treatment. Patient expectation and hope (OR:2.08, 95\% CI:[1.48,2.93] and 2.48 [1.73,3.55], respectively), and clinician perception (12.18 [8.31,17.84]) were associated with antibiotic prescribing. 2,354 (92.6\%) patients were satisfied. Only those hoping for antibiotics were less satisfied when antibiotics were not prescribed (0.39 [0.17,0.90]).
Conclusion: Patient views about antibiotic treatment were not useful for identifying those who will benefit from antibiotics. Clinician perceptions did not match with patient views, but particularly influenced antibiotic prescribing. Patients were generally satisfied with care, but those hoping for but not prescribed antibiotics were less satisfied. Clinicians need to more effectively elicit and address patient views about antibiotics.},

	abstract = {Background: Unnecessary prescribing of antibiotics is a major public health concern. General practitioners (GPs) prescribe most antibiotics, often for upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs), and have in general been shown to prescribe antibiotics more often to women. No studies have examined the influence of patient gender on unnecessary antibiotic prescribing.
Objectives: To study a possible gender difference in unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions for URTIs in general practice; to assess whether a possible difference is explained by patient demand for antibiotics.
Methods: Post-hoc analysis of a cross-sectional study including 15 022 patients with URTI (acute rhinitis, acute otitis media, acute sinusitis, acute pharyngotonsillitis) from Argentina, Denmark, Lithuania, Russia, Spain and Sweden (HAPPY AUDIT Project). The association between gender and unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions, unadjusted and adjusted for treatment demand, was analysed using logistic regression models.
Results: A total of 25\% of patients with URTI received antibiotics; in 45\% of the cases, antibiotics were unnecessary. Overall, no gender difference for unnecessary prescribing of antibiotics for URTIs was found. Women with acute otitis media received an unnecessary antibiotic twice as often as men (14.4\% versus 7.1\%). In Danish patients with acute pharyngotonsillitis, there was a gender difference in unnecessary prescriptions for antibiotics (women 29.1\% versus men 48.6\%). Some 14\% of patients receiving unnecessary antibiotics demonstrated a demand for antibiotics, but no gender difference was found in this group.
Conclusion: This study indicated a high rate of unnecessary antibiotic prescribing for URTIs in general practice, but overall found no gender differences in receiving unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions.},

Design: Questionnaire study of practitioners and patients. Setting: General practice in Newcastle, Australia. Subjects: 22 non-randomly selected general practitioners and 336 of their patients with a newly diagnosed medical condition. Main outcome measures: Prescription of medication and expectation of it
Results: Medication was prescribed for 169 (50\%) patients. After controlling for the presenting condition, patients who expected medication were nearly three times more likely to receive medication (odds ratio = 2.9,95\% confidence interval 1.3 to 6.3). When the general practitioner thought the patient expected medication the patient was 10 times more likely to receive it (odds ratio = 10.1, 5.3 to 19.6). A significant association existed between patients' expectation and doctors' perception of patients' expectation (x2 = 52.0, df = 4, P = 0.001). For all categories of patient expectation, however, patients were more likely to receive medication when the practitioner judged the patient to want medication than when the practitioner ascribed no expectation to the patient.
Conclusions: Although patients brought expectations to the consultation regarding medication, the doctors' opinions about their expectations were the strongest determinants of prescribing.},

Prescribing is rising and is influenced by patients’ consulting behaviour and beliefs. Aim To build up a profile of the ‘RTI clinical iceberg’ by exploring how the general public manage RTI, visit GPs and why. Design and setting Two-phase qualitative and quantitative study in England.
Method Qualitative interviews with 17 participants with acute RTI visiting pharmacies in England, and face-to-face questionnaire survey of 1767 adults ≥15 years in households in England during January 2011.
Results Qualitative interviews: interviewees with RTI visited GPs if they considered their symptoms were prolonged, or severe enough to cause pain, or interfered with daily activities or sleep. Questionnaire: 58\% reported having had an RTI in the previous 6 months, and 19.7\% (95\% CI = 16.8 to 22.9\%) of these contacted or visited their GP surgery for this, most commonly because ‘the symptoms were severe’; or ‘after several days the symptoms hadn’t improved’; 10.3\% of those experiencing an RTI (or 53.1\% of those contacting their GP about it) expected an antibiotic prescription. Responders were more likely to believe antibiotics would be effective for a cough with green rather than clear phlegm. Perceptions of side effects of antibiotics did not influence expectations for antibiotics. Almost all who reported asking for an antibiotic were prescribed one, but 25\% did not finish them.
Conclusion One-fifth of those with an RTI contact their GP and most who ask for antibiotics are prescribed them. A better public understanding about the lack of benefit of antibiotics for most RTIs and addressing concerns about illness duration and severity, could reduce GP consultations and antibiotic prescriptions for RTI.},

	abstract = {Background Young children may be at increased risk for serious complications from influenzavirus infection. However, in population-based studies it has been difficult to separate the effects of influenzavirus from those of respiratory syncytial virus. Respiratory syncytial virus often circulates with influenzaviruses and is the most frequent cause of hospitalization for lower respiratory tract infections in infants and young children. We studied the rates of hospitalization for acute respiratory disease among infants and children during periods when the circulation of influenzaviruses predominated over the circulation of respiratory syncytial virus.
Methods For each season from October to May during the period from 1992 to 1997, we used local viral surveillance data to define periods in Washington State and northern California when the circulation of influenzaviruses predominated over that of respiratory syncytial virus. We calculated the rates of hospitalization for acute respiratory disease, excess rates attributable to influenzavirus, and incidence-rate ratios for all infants and children younger than 18 years of age who were enrolled in either the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program of Northern California or the Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound.
Results The rates of hospitalization for acute respiratory disease among children who did not have conditions that put them at high risk for complications of influenza (e.g., asthma, cardiovascular diseases, or premature birth) and who were younger than two years of age were 231 per 100,000 personmonths at Northern California Kaiser sites (from 1993 to 1997) and 193 per 100,000 person-months at Group Health Cooperative sites (from 1992 to 1997). These rates were approximately 12 times as high as the rates among children without high-risk conditions who were 5 to 17 years of age (19 per 100,000 person-months at Northern California Kaiser sites and 16 per 100,000 person-months at Group Health Cooperative sites) and approached the rates among children with chronic health conditions who were 5 to 17 years of age (386 per 100,000 person-months and 216 per 100,000 person-months, respectively).
Conclusions Infants and young children without chronic or serious medical conditions are at increased risk for hospitalization during influenza seasons. Routine influenza vaccination should be considered in these children. (N Engl J Med 2000;342:232-9.)},

	abstract = {Objective—To describe the prevalence of non-acute conditions among patients seeking healthcare in a defined US population, emphasizing age, sex, and ethnic differences.
Methods—The Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP) records-linkage system was used to identify all residents of Olmsted County, MN on April 1, 2009 (n=142,377). We then electronically extracted all International Classification of Diseases, ninth revision (ICD-9) codes received by these subjects from any health care provider between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2009. We grouped ICD-9 codes into Clinical Classification Codes (CCCs), and then into 47 broader disease groups associated with health-related quality of life. Age- and sex-specific prevalence was estimated by dividing the number of individuals within each group by the corresponding age- and sex-specific population. People with multiple codes within a group were counted only once.
Results—We included a total of 142,377 subjects (53\% women). Skin disorders (42.7\%), osteoarthritis and joint disorders (33.6\%), back problems (23.9\%), disorders of lipid metabolism (22.4\%), and upper respiratory disease (22.1\%; excluding asthma) were the most prevalent disease groups in this population. Eight of the 10 most prevalent disease groups were more common in women; however, disorders of lipid metabolism and hypertension were more common in men. Additionally, the prevalence of seven of these 10 groups increased with advancing age. Prevalence varied also across whites, blacks, and Asians.
Conclusion—Our findings suggest areas for focused research that may lead to better care delivery and improved population health.},

What factors influence patients' expectations and general practitioners' actions? Aim. This study aimed to examine these questions with reference to prescribing and hospital referral.
Method. The study covered 1080 consultations with 12 general practitioners in two north London practices. Information was collected by self-administered questionnaires from patients before the consultation and from the general practitioners after the consultation.
Results. Fifty one per cent of patients expected and 55\% received a prescription; 13\% expected hospital referral and 10\% were referred. Factors related to their presenting problem were most strongly associated with patients' expectation of receiving a prescription. The actions which the general practitioners took were most strongly associated with patients' expectations. Patients' anxiety about their health problem also appeared to influence their expectations of referral and the doctor's prescribing decision.
Conclusion. This study suggests that patients' expectation of management and their anxiety associated with the presenting problem may be two of the factors which influence general practitioners' prescribing and referral behaviour and may explain some of the observed variations in behaviour.},

	abstract = {Numerous opportunities are available in primary care for alleviating the crisis of increasing antibiotic resistance. Preventing patients from developing an acute respiratory infection (ARI) will obviate any need for antibiotic use downstream. Hygiene measures such as physical barriers and hand hygiene, and possibly vaccination and exercise, may be effective. Also, a large range of complementary and alternative medicines (e.g. zinc, vitamin C and probiotics) are proposed for preventing and treating ARIs, but evidence for efﬁcacy is scarce. General practitioners’ (GPs) attitudes towards antibiotic prescribing are a major factor in the prescribing for ARIs. Professional interventions with educational components are effective, although they have modest effects, and are expensive. GPs’ perceptions – that mistakenly assume as a default that patients want antibiotics for their ARIs – are often wrong. Shared decision making might be a solution, as it enables clinician and patient to participate jointly in making a health decision, having discussed the options together with the evidence for their harms as well as beneﬁts. Furthermore, GPs’ diagnostic uncertainty – often leading to an antibiotic prescription “just in case” – might be addressed by exploiting strategies such as safety-netting, e.g., establishing with the patient a priori clearly deﬁned actions to take if the course of the illness deviates from the expected. None of these strategies or interventions on their own will greatly improve the use of antibiotics for ARIs. However, used in concert, combinations are likely to enable clinicians and health care systems to implement the strategies that will reduce antimicrobial resistance in the future.},

	abstract = {Objectives: Countries generally present their overall use of antibiotics as an indicator of antibiotic prescribing quality. Additional insight is urgently needed for targeted improvement recommendations: ﬁrst, data on speciﬁc clinical indications for which antibiotics are used, and second, on distinguishing whether changes in patient consultation or changes in physician prescribing drive changing antibiotic use for particular indications. The aim of this study was to describe the antibiotic management of infectious diseases in the clinical context, by analysing prescribing by physicians and patient consultation incidences per indication over time.
Methods: A database with all contact data for infectious diseases from 45 primary care practices in the Netherlands (2007– 10) was used. Consultation incidences, prescribing rates and choice of antibiotic were analysed per International Classiﬁcation of Primary Care (ICPC) chapter and relevant ICPC codes.
Results: Antibiotics were prescribed in 25\% of infectious disease episodes, mainly respiratory infections, urinary infections and ear and skin infections. Overall, this resulted in 300 prescribed courses of antibiotics per 1000 patient – years. Given a stable prescription rate, a 19\% increase in the number of consultations explained the increased antibiotic prescribing for urinary tract infections. Given a stable consultation incidence, an 8\% reduction in prescribing rate explained the decreased antibiotic prescribing for respiratory tract infections. Macrolides were predominantly prescribed for respiratory disease ( 66\%), amoxicillin/clavulanate for respiratory disease ( 42\%) and urinary illness ( 25\%), and ﬂuoroquinolones for urinary and genital indications.
Conclusions: Insight into the reasons for the decreased prescribing for respiratory tract infections and the increased prescribing for urinary tract infections was provided by a detailed analysis of incidences and prescribing rates. For respiratory disease, the second- and third-choice antibiotics were overused. Complete data on infectious disease management, with respect to patient and physician behaviour, are crucial for understanding changes in antibiotic use, and in deﬁning strategies to reduce inappropriate antibiotic use.},

Although for some conditions there appeared to be inappropriately high levels of antibacterial prescribing, the antibiotics chosen were usually those recommended for ﬁrst-line treatment.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Overuse of antibiotics in the treatment of acute respiratory tract infection (ARI) contributes to the growing problem of antibiotic-resistant infections.
OBJECTIVE: To identify factors that influence community practitioners to prescribe antibiotics and examine how they differ from the recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guideline for treatment of ARI. DESIGN: Paper case vignette study using a fractional factorial design. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred one community practitioners and eight faculty members. MAIN MEASUREMENTS: We asked community practitioners to estimate how likely they would be to prescribe antibiotics in each of 20 cases of ARI and then used multiple regression to infer the importance weights of each of nine clinical findings. We then compared practitioners’ weights with those of a panel of eight faculty physicians who evaluated the cases following the CDC guidelines rather than their own judgments. MAIN RESULTS: Practitioners prescribed antibiotics in 44.5\% of cases, over twice the percentage treated by the panel using the CDC guidelines (20\%). In deciding to prescribe antibiotic treatment, practitioners gave little or no weight to patient factors such as whether the patients wanted antibiotics. Although weighting patterns differed among practitioners, the majority (72\%) gave the greatest weight to duration of illness. When illness duration was short, the rate of prescribing (20.1\%) was the same as the rate of the faculty panel (20\%).
CONCLUSIONS: Based on hypothetical cases of ARI, community practitioners prescribed antibiotics at twice the rate of faculty following CDC practice guidelines. Practitioners were most strongly influenced by duration of illness. The effect of duration was strongest when accompanied by fever or productive cough, suggesting that these situations would be important areas for practitioner education and further clinical studies.},

The magnitude of this cost is the main biological parameter that influences the rate of development of resistance, the stability of the resistance and the rate at which the resistance might decrease if antibiotic use were reduced. These findings suggest that the fitness costs of resistance will allow susceptible bacteria to outcompete resistant bacteria if the selective pressure from antibiotics is reduced. Unfortunately, the available data suggest that the rate of reversibility will be slow at the community level. Here, we review the factors that influence the fitness costs of antibiotic resistance, the ways by which bacteria can reduce these costs and the possibility of exploiting them.},

	abstract = {Objective To systematically review the literature and, where appropriate, meta-analyse studies investigating subsequent antibiotic resistance in individuals prescribed antibiotics in primary care. Design Systematic review with meta-analysis. Data sources Observational and experimental studies identified through Medline, Embase, and Cochrane searches. Review methods Electronic searches using MeSH terms and text words identified 4373 papers. Two independent reviewers assessed quality of eligible studies and extracted data. Meta-analyses were conducted for studies presenting similar outcomes.
Results The review included 24 studies; 22 involved patients with symptomatic infection and two involved healthy volunteers; 19 were observational studies (of which two were prospective) and five were randomised trials. In five studies of urinary tract bacteria (14 348 participants), the pooled odds ratio (OR) for resistance was 2.5 (95\% confidence interval 2.1 to 2.9) within 2 months of antibiotic treatment and 1.33 (1.2 to 1.5) within 12 months. In seven studies of respiratory tract bacteria (2605 participants), pooled ORs were 2.4 (1.4 to 3.9) and 2.4 (1.3 to 4.5) for the same periods, respectively. Studies reporting the quantity of antibiotic prescribed found that longer duration and multiple courses were associated with higher rates of resistance. Studies comparing the potential for different antibiotics to induce resistance showed no consistent effects. Only one prospective study reported changes in resistance over a long period; pooled ORs fell from 12.2 (6.8 to 22.1) at 1 week to 6.1 (2.8 to 13.4) at 1 month, 3.6 (2.2 to 6.0) at 2 months, and 2.2 (1.3 to 3.6) at 6 months.
Conclusions Individuals prescribed an antibiotic in primary care for a respiratory or urinary infection develop bacterial resistance to that antibiotic. The effect is greatest in the month immediately after treatment but may persist for up to 12 months. This effect not only increases the population carriage of organisms resistant to first line antibiotics, but also creates the conditions for increased use of second line antibiotics in the},

Patients followed up for 28 days with patient diaries. Setting Primary care. Participants Adults with a new or worsening cough or clinical presentation suggestive of lower respiratory tract infection. Main outcome measures Prescribing of antibiotics by clinicians and total symptom severity scores over time.
Results 3402 patients were recruited (clinicians completed a case report form for 99\% (3368) of participants and 80\% (2714) returned a symptom diary). Mean symptom severity scores at presentation ranged from 19 (scale range 0 to 100) in networks based in Spain and Italy to 38 in the network based in Sweden. Antibiotic prescribing by networks ranged from 20\% to nearly 90\% (53\% overall), with wide variation in classes of antibiotics prescribed. Amoxicillin was overall the most common antibiotic prescribed, but this ranged from 3\% of antibiotics prescribed in the Norwegian network to 83\% in the English network. While fluoroquinolones were not prescribed at all in three networks, they were prescribed for 18\% in the Milan network. After adjustment for clinical presentation and demographics, considerable differences remained in antibiotic prescribing, ranging from Norway (odds ratio 0.18, 95\% confidence interval 0.11 to 0.30) to Slovakia (11.2, 6.20 to 20.27) compared with the overall mean (proportion prescribed: 0.53). The rate of recovery was similar for patients who were and were not prescribed antibiotics (coefficient −0.01, P{\textless}0.01) once clinical presentation was taken into account.

	abstract = {PURPOSE We undertook a study to estimate the sufficiently important difference (SID) for the common cold. The SID is the smallest benefit that an intervention would require to justify costs and risks.
METHODS Benefit-harm tradeoff interviews (in-person and telephone) assessed SID in terms of overall severity reduction using evidence-based simple-language scenarios for 4 common cold treatments: vitamin C, the herbal medicine echinacea, zinc lozenges, and the unlicensed antiviral pleconaril.
RESULTS Response patterns to the 4 scenarios in the telephone and in-person samples were not statistically distinguishable and were merged for most analyses. The scenario based on vitamin C led to a mean SID of 25\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.23-0.27). For the echinacea-based scenario, mean SID was 32\% (95\% CI, 0.30-0.34). For the zinc-based scenario, mean SID was 47\% (95\% CI, 0.43-0.51). The scenario based on preliminary antiviral trials provided a mean SID of 57\% (95\% CI, 0.53-0.61). Multivariate analyses suggested that (1) betweenscenario differences were substantive and reproducible in the 2 samples, (2) presence or severity of illness did not predict SID, and (3) SID was not influenced by age, sex, tobacco use, ethnicity, income, or education. Despite consistencies supporting the model and methods, response patterns were diverse, with wide spreads of individual SID values within and among treatment scenarios.
CONCLUSIONS Depending on treatment specifics, people want an on-average 25\% to 57\% reduction in overall illness severity to justify costs and risks of popular cold treatments. Randomized trial evidence does not support benefits this large. This model and these methods should be further developed for use in other disease entities.},

A description of key aspects of the CSM’s history—over 50 years of research and theoretical development—makes clear the model’s dynamic underpinnings, characteristics, and assumptions. The current article provides this historical narrative and uses that narrative to highlight dynamic aspects of the model that are often not evaluated or utilized in contemporary CSM-based research. We provide suggestions for research advances that can more fully utilize these dynamic aspects of the CSM and have the potential to further advance the CSM’s contribution to medical practice and patients’ self-management of illness.},

Design: Qualitative study with semi-structured interviews. Setting: General practices in South Wales. Subjects: 21 general practitioners and 17 of their patients who had recently consulted for a sore throat or upper respiratory tract infection. Main outcome measures: Subjects’ experience of management of the illness, patients’ expectations, beliefs about antibiotic treatment for sore throats, and ideas for reducing prescribing.
Results: Doctors knew of the evidence for marginal effectiveness yet often prescribed for good relationships with patients. Possible patient benefit outweighed theoretical community risk from resistant bacteria. Most doctors found prescribing “against the evidence” uncomfortable and realised this probably increased workload. Explanations of the distinction between virus and bacterium often led to perceived confusion. Clinicians were divided on the value of leaflets and national campaigns, but several favoured patient empowerment for self care by other members of the primary care team. Patient expectations were seldom made explicit, and many were not met. A third of patients had a clear expectation for antibiotics, and mothers were more likely to accept non-antibiotic treatment for their children than for themselves. Satisfaction was not necessarily related to receiving antibiotics, with many seeking reassurance, further information, and pain relief.

Of 10 981 randomly selected adults from England, Scotland and Wales, 7120 (65\%) completed the questionnaire.
Results: Although 79\% of respondents were aware that ‘antibiotic resistance is a problem in British hospitals’, 38\% of respondents did not know that antibiotics do not work against most coughs or colds and 43\% did not know that ‘antibiotics can kill the bacteria that normally live on the skin and in the gut’. Respondents with lower educational qualiﬁcations were less knowledgeable about antibiotics. In a multivariable analysis, better knowledge of antibiotics was not associated with being less likely to be prescribed any in the last year, but was independently associated with being more likely to ﬁnish a course of antibiotic as prescribed. Knowledge was also associated with being more likely to take antibiotics without being told to do so. In women, better knowledge was associated with being more likely to give an antibiotic to someone else that was not prescribed for them.
Conclusions: We have shown that there is no simple relationship between increased knowledge and more prudent antibiotic use. Future national antibiotic campaigns should have a deﬁned audience and aims in order to facilitate prudent antibiotic use by clinicians and public.},

Methods In total, 1101 respondents were interviewed on their attitudes towards appropriateness of self-medication with antibiotics and situational use of antibiotics, beliefs about antibiotics for minor ailments, knowledge about the effectiveness of antibiotics on viruses and bacteria and awareness about antibiotic resistance. To deal with the possible confounding effect of both use of self-medication and education we performed stratiﬁed analyses, i.e. separate analyses for users and non-users of self-medication, and for respondents with high and low education. The differences between countries were considered relevant when regression coefﬁcients were signiﬁcant in all stratum-speciﬁc analyses.
Results Respondents from the UK, Malta, Italy, Czech Republic, Croatia, Israel and Lithuania had signiﬁcantly less appropriate attitudes, beliefs or knowledge for at least one of the dimensions compared with Swedish respondents. The Dutch, Austrian and Belgian respondents did not differ from Swedish for any dimension.
Conclusions The most pronounced differences were for awareness about resistance, followed by attitudes towards situational use of antibiotics. Awareness about antibiotic resistance was the lowest in countries with higher prevalence of resistance. Copyright \# 2007 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

We studied consecutive outpatients undergoing colonoscopy who were medically stable, mentally competent, and able to speak English ðn ¼ 682Þ. By random assignment, half the patients had a short interval added to the end of their procedure during which the tip of the colonoscope remained in the rectum. Pain during the procedure was measured with a ten point intensity scale. Memory following the procedure was measured using both a rating scale and a ranking task. Randomization resulted in two similar groups. As theorized, patients who underwent the extended procedure experienced the ﬁnal moments as less painful (1.7 vs. 2.5 on a ten point intensity scale, P , 0:001), rated the entire experience as less unpleasant (4.4 vs. 4.9 on a 10 cm visual analogue scale, P ¼ 0:006), and ranked the procedure as less aversive compared to seven other unpleasant experiences (4.1 vs. 4.6 with eight as the worst, P ¼ 0:002). Rates of returning for a repeat colonoscopy (median duration of follow-up 5.3 years) averaged 50.4\% and were slightly higher (odds ratio ¼ 1.41, P ¼ 0:038) for those who underwent the longer procedure controlling for prior colonoscopy, procedure indications, and abnormal ﬁndings.

Non-clinical influences on clinical decision-making profoundly affect medical decisions. These influences include patient-related factors such as socioeconomic status, quality of life and patient’s expectations and wishes, physician-related factors such as personal characteristics and interaction with their professional community, and features of clinical practice such as private versus public practice as well as local management policies. This review brings together the different strands of knowledge concerning non-clinical influences on clinical decision-making. This aspect of decision-making may be the biggest obstacle to the reality of practising evidence-based medicine. It needs to be understood in order to develop clinical strategies that will facilitate the practice of evidence-based medicine.},

	abstract = {Standard theories of decision-making involving delayed outcomes predict that people should defer a punishment, whilst advancing a reward. In some cases, such as pain, people seem to prefer to expedite punishment, implying that its anticipation carries a cost, often conceptualized as ‘dread’. Despite empirical support for the existence of dread, whether and how it depends on prospective delay is unknown. Furthermore, it is unclear whether dread represents a stable component of value, or is modulated by biases such as framing effects. Here, we examine choices made between different numbers of painful shocks to be delivered faithfully at different time points up to 15 minutes in the future, as well as choices between hypothetical painful dental appointments at time points of up to approximately eight months in the future, to test alternative models for how future pain is disvalued. We show that future pain initially becomes increasingly aversive with increasing delay, but does so at a decreasing rate. This is consistent with a value model in which moment-bymoment dread increases up to the time of expected pain, such that dread becomes equivalent to the discounted expectation of pain. For a minority of individuals pain has maximum negative value at intermediate delay, suggesting that the dread function may itself be prospectively discounted in time. Framing an outcome as relief reduces the overall preference to expedite pain, which can be parameterized by reducing the rate of the dread-discounting function. Our data support an account of disvaluation for primary punishments such as pain, which differs fundamentally from existing models applied to financial punishments, in which dread exerts a powerful but time-dependent influence over choice.},

	abstract = {Objectives. Individuals may be overly sensitive to the side effects of treatments aimed at preventing illness, in part because they have difﬁculty in evaluating situations with several possible outcomes that differ in probability. This study tested willingness to undergo a hypothetical preventive treatment and accuracy in determining the probability of harm from the treatment as a function of the presence of a side effect, the initial probability of harm, the format in which probabilities were presented (percentages or frequencies), and the presence or absence of a graphic. Design. The study was a factorial experiment involving 5,251 participants.
Methods. Participants recruited from a health-oriented internet site read about a hypothetical cancer prevention treatment situation and were asked to indicate their willingness to accept this treatment and whether it would increase or decrease their overall risk of cancer. The net beneﬁt of the treatment was the same in all conditions, whether or not it was associated with a small side effect.
Results. The presence of information about a side effect dramatically decreased willingness to undergo preventive treatment and accuracy in evaluating the treatment’s effects. Willingness and accuracy were not inﬂuenced by the initial probability of harm, whether the risk probability information was presented as frequencies (N in 100) or as percentages, or whether the initial risk was presented with a bar graph or an array of asterisks or stick ﬁgures.
Conclusions. Individuals are highly averse to preventive treatments with even small side effects and have difﬁculty combining the likelihood of positive and negative outcomes to determine the treatment’s overall beneﬁts.},

	abstract = {Objectives: To systematically review clinicians’ knowledge and beliefs about the importance and causes of antibiotic resistance, and strategies to reduce resistance.
Methods: Four databases were searched (until July 2014), without restrictions on language, setting or study design. Fixed responses (from surveys) were grouped into categories. The proportion of participants who agreed with each category was expressed as median, percentage and IQR. Qualitative data were coded into emergent themes. Quantitative categories and qualitative themes were grouped into four overarching categories that emerged from the data.
Results: There were 57 included studies (38 quantitative, 14 qualitative, 5 mixed methods) of 11593 clinicians. Most clinicians (69\%, IQR 63\%–72\%, n¼5 studies) had heard of antibiotic resistance and 98\% (IQR 93\%–99\%, n¼5 studies) believed it was serious. The proportion who believed it was a problem for their practice (67\%, IQR 65\%–74\%, n¼ 13 studies) was smaller than the proportion who believed it was a problem globally (89\%, IQR 85\%–97\%, n¼5 studies) or nationally (92\%, IQR 88\%–95\%, n¼21 studies). Most believed excessive antibiotic use (97\%, IQR 91\%–98\%, n¼12 studies) and patient non-adherence (90\%, IQR 82\%–92\%, n¼7 studies) caused resistance. Most knew of strategies to reduce resistance (e.g. clinician education, 90\%, IQR 85\%–96\%, n¼7 studies). Qualitative ﬁndings support these data: they attributed responsibility for antibiotic resistance to patients, other countries and healthcare settings; resistance was considered a low priority and a distant consequence of antibiotic prescribing.
Conclusions: Clinicians believe antibiotic resistance is a serious problem, but think it is caused by others. This needs to be accommodated in interventions to reduce antibiotic resistance.},

Methods: We searched four databases to July 2014, with no language or study design restrictions. Two reviewers independently extracted data.

Results: Of 3537 articles screened, 54 studies (41 quantitative, 3 mixed methods and 10 qualitative) were included (55 225 participants). Most studied adults (50; 93\% studies) and were conducted in Europe (23; 43\%), Asia (14; 26\%) or North America (12; 22\%). Some participants [median 70\% (IQR 50\% –84\%); n¼ 8 studies] had heard of antibiotic resistance, but most [median 88\% (IQR 86\% –89\%); n¼ 2 studies] believed it referred to changes in the human body. Many believed excessive antibiotic use [median 70\% (IQR 59\% – 77\%); n ¼ 11 studies] and not completing antibiotic courses [median 62\% (IQR 47\% –77\%); n¼ 8 studies] caused resistance. Most participants nominated reducing antibiotic use [median 74\% (IQR 72\% –85\%); n¼ 4 studies] and discussing antibiotic resistance with their clinician (84\%, n ¼ 1 study) as strategies to reduce resistance. Qualitative data supported these ﬁndings and additionally identiﬁed that: participants believed they were at low risk from antibiotic resistance participants; largely attributed its development to the actions of others; and strategies to minimize resistance should be primarily aimed at clinicians.
Conclusions: The public have an incomplete understanding of antibiotic resistance and misperceptions about it and its causes and do not believe they contribute to its development. These data can be used to inform interventions to change the public’s beliefs about how they can contribute to tackling this global issue.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2334-14-13},
	abstract = {Background: Greater use of antibiotics during the past 50 years has exerted selective pressure on susceptible bacteria and may have favoured the survival of resistant strains. Existing information on antibiotic resistance patterns from pathogens circulating among community-based patients is substantially less than from hospitalized patients on whom guidelines are often based. We therefore chose to assess the relationship between the antibiotic resistance pattern of bacteria circulating in the community and the consumption of antibiotics in the community.
Methods: Both gray literature and published scientific literature in English and other European languages was examined. Multiple regression analysis was used to analyse whether studies found a positive relationship between antibiotic consumption and resistance. A subsequent meta-analysis and meta-regression was conducted for studies for which a common effect size measure (odds ratio) could be calculated.
Results: Electronic searches identified 974 studies but only 243 studies were considered eligible for inclusion by the two independent reviewers who extracted the data. A binomial test revealed a positive relationship between antibiotic consumption and resistance (p {\textless} .001) but multiple regression modelling did not produce any significant predictors of study outcome. The meta-analysis generated a significant pooled odds ratio of 2.3 (95\% confidence interval 2.2 to 2.5) with a meta-regression producing several significant predictors (F(10,77) = 5.82, p {\textless} .01). Countries in southern Europe produced a stronger link between consumption and resistance than other regions.
Conclusions: Using a large set of studies we found that antibiotic consumption is associated with the development of antibiotic resistance. A subsequent meta-analysis, with a subsample of the studies, generated several significant predictors. Countries in southern Europe produced a stronger link between consumption and resistance than other regions so efforts at reducing antibiotic consumption may need to be strengthened in this area. Increased consumption of antibiotics may not only produce greater resistance at the individual patient level but may also produce greater resistance at the community, country, and regional levels, which can harm individual patients.},

Results-Parents felt disempowered when dealing with acute illness in their children because of difficulties making sense of the illness. Central to parents' difficulties were their experiences of inadequate information sharing by their general practitioners and variations in their doctors' decisions and behaviour. Disparity between parents' beliefs and expectations about illness and treatment and professionals' behaviour further frustrated parents' attempts to understand illness. Parents expressed a need for a range of accessible and specific information to support them through their negotiation of children's illness.
Conclusions-Communication with parents requires greater recognition of parents' difficulties. Professionals have considerable potential to empower parents by sharing more information and skills. Such information should be consistent and address parents' concerns, beliefs, and expressed needs if this potential is to be realised.},

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Two hundred seventythree (70\%) of the respondents reported that antibiotics were beneficial for bacterial respiratory illnesses, 211 (55\%) reported that antibiotics were beneficial for viral respiratory illnesses, and 82 (21\%) reported that antibiotics were beneficial for bacterial but not for viral illness. Multivariate regression analysis identified consulting an advice nurse (odds ratio [OR] 2.9; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.7, 5.3), ever being told by a provider that antibiotics were not needed for a respiratory illness episode (OR 2.0; 95\% CI 1.2, 3.6), having a chronic medical condition (OR 2.0; 95\% CI 1.0, 3.9), and believing antibiotics to be helpful for viral (OR 2.5; 95\% CI 1.3, 4.7) or bacterial (OR 2.6; 95\% CI 1.2, 6.7) respiratory illnesses to be independently associated with antibiotic use for respiratory illnesses during the previous year. There was a trend toward lower previous antibiotic use among those believing antibiotics to be helpful for bacterial illness but not for viral illness.
CONCLUSIONS: A lack of understanding about antibiotic effectiveness exists in the community. Increased previous antibiotic use among those believing antibiotics to be effective for viral illnesses suggests that improvements are needed in communications to patients and the public about antibiotic appropriateness.},

As little is known about their effect on populations challenged by less access to care, lower education, low income, low English proficiency, or nonmainstream cultural backgrounds, this study assessed knowledge, attitudes, and awareness in an ethnically diverse community.
Methods. A telephone survey in English or Spanish of a cross-sectional, random sample of 692 non-Hispanic whites (NHWs) and 300 Hispanics in Colorado.
Results. For all respondent groups, knowledge of appropriate antibiotic use for colds and bronchitis was low. Hispanics surveyed in Spanish, compared with non-Hispanic whites, had significantly lower knowledge about antibiotics for colds, higher knowledge for bronchitis, lower awareness about antibiotic resistance, and greater dissatisfaction if an antibiotic were not prescribed. In all comparisons, English-language Hispanics tended to reflect non-Hispanic white response patterns. Independent predictors of awareness were ethnicity, education, and age. Independent predictors of dissatisfaction were ethnicity, knowledge about antibiotic use for colds, and bronchitis. Ethnicity was an independent predictor of knowledge about the inappropriateness of antibiotics for colds and bronchitis.
Conclusions. To bridge knowledge gaps, educational campaigns for all segments of the population are needed. Content should be responsive to heterogeneity within populations. D 2004 The Institute For Cancer Prevention and Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Objective To assess how pressures from patients on doctors in the consultation contribute to referral and investigation. Design Observational study nested within a randomised controlled trial. Setting Five general practices in three settings in the United Kingdom. Participants 847 consecutive patients, aged 16-80 years. Main outcomes measures Patient preferences and doctors’ perception of patient pressure and medical need.
Results Perceived medical need was the strongest independent predictor of all behaviours and confounded all other predictors. The doctors thought, however, there was no or only a slight indication for medical need among a significant minority of those who were examined (89/580, 15\%), received a prescription (74/394, 19\%), or were referred (27/125, 22\%) and almost half of those investigated (99/216, 46\%). After controlling for patient preference, medical need, and clustering by doctor, doctors’ perceptions of patient pressure were strongly associated with prescribing (adjusted odds ratio 2.87, 95\% confidence interval 1.16 to 7.08) and even more strongly associated with examination (4.38, 1.24 to 15.5), referral (10.72, 2.08 to 55.3), and investigation (3.18, 1.31 to 7.70). In all cases, doctors’ perception of patient pressure was a stronger predictor than patients’ preferences. Controlling for randomisation group, mean consultation time, or patient variables did not alter estimates or inferences.
Conclusions Doctors’ behaviour in the consultation is most strongly associated with perceived medical need of the patient, which strongly confounds other predictors. However, a significant minority of examining, prescribing, and referral, and almost half of investigations, are still thought by the doctor to be slightly needed or not needed at all, and perceived patient pressure is a strong independent predictor of all doctor behaviours. To limit unnecessary resource use and iatrogenesis, when management decisions are not thought to be medically needed, doctors need to directly ask patients about their expectations.},

Methods. Random-digit-dialing telephone surveys of adults and parents of children {\textless}5 years old were conducted in Wisconsin and Minnesota during 1999.
Results. The survey was completed by 405 adults and 275 parents of children {\textless}5 years old. The median age was 32 years for parents and 50 years for adults. Seven percent of parents and 17\% of adults believed that antibiotics are never or almost never necessary for bronchitis. More than 70\% in each group believed that antibiotics are needed for green or yellow nasal drainage, and nearly half of respondents believed that they knew whether an antibiotic was needed before seeing a physician. Exposure to multiple information sources on antibiotic resistance in the past 6 months was independently associated with a knowledge score greater than or equal to the median for nine questions.
Conclusions. The general public has misconceptions regarding indications for antibiotic use, and this may contribute to inappropriate prescribing. Providing multiple and varied antibiotic-related informational messages may increase knowledge of appropriate antibiotic prescribing and decrease patient demand for antibiotics. © 2002 American Health Foundation and Elsevier Science (USA)},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE To estimate the rates of outpatient oral antibiotic prescribing by age and diagnosis, and the estimated portions of antibiotic use that may be inappropriate in adults and children in the United States. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Using the 2010-2011 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, annual numbers and population-adjusted rates with 95\% confidence intervals of ambulatory visits with oral antibiotic prescriptions by age, region, and diagnosis in the United States were estimated. Editorial page 1839 Supplemental content at jama.com CME Quiz at jamanetworkcme.com EXPOSURES Ambulatory care visits. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Based on national guidelines and regional variation in prescribing, diagnosis-specific prevalence and rates of total and appropriate antibiotic prescriptions were determined. These rates were combined to calculate an estimate of the appropriate annual rate of antibiotic prescriptions per 1000 population.
RESULTS Of the 184 032 sampled visits, 12.6\% of visits (95\% CI, 12.0\%-13.3\%) resulted in antibiotic prescriptions. Sinusitis was the single diagnosis associated with the most antibiotic prescriptions per 1000 population (56 antibiotic prescriptions [95\% CI, 48-64]), followed by suppurative otitis media (47 antibiotic prescriptions [95\% CI, 41-54]), and pharyngitis (43 antibiotic prescriptions [95\% CI, 38-49]). Collectively, acute respiratory conditions per 1000 population led to 221 antibiotic prescriptions (95\% CI, 198-245) annually, but only 111 antibiotic prescriptions were estimated to be appropriate for these conditions. Per 1000 population, among all conditions and ages combined in 2010-2011, an estimated 506 antibiotic prescriptions (95\% CI, 458-554) were written annually, and, of these, 353 antibiotic prescriptions were estimated to be appropriate antibiotic prescriptions.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In the United States in 2010-2011, there was an estimated annual antibiotic prescription rate per 1000 population of 506, but only an estimated 353 antibiotic prescriptions were likely appropriate, supporting the need for establishing a goal for outpatient antibiotic stewardship.},

	abstract = {Objectives: To measure patients’ expectations of receiving prescriptions and general practitioners’ perceptions of these expectations and to determine the factors most closely associated with the decision to prescribe. Design: Questionnaires were completed by patients waiting to see their general practitioners, and by their doctors immediately after the consultations. Setting: Four non-fundholding group practices in southeast London. Subjects: 544 unselected patients consulting 15 general practitioners. Main outcome measures: Doctors’ perceptions of patients’ expectations; doctors’ decisions to prescribe.
Results: 67\% (354/526) of patients hoped for a prescription; doctors perceived that 56\% (305/542) of patients wanted prescriptions; and doctors wrote prescriptions in 59\% (321/543) of consultations. Despite the close agreement between patients’ hopes and doctors’ perceptions, 25\% (89/353) of patients hoped for a prescription but did not receive one. In 22\% (68/313) of consultations in which prescriptions were written, they were not strictly indicated on purely medical grounds, and in only 66\% (202/306) of consultations in which prescriptions were written were they both indicated and hoped for. Doctors’ perceptions of patients’ expectations were the strongest predictor of the decision to prescribe, but the final regression model also included patients’ hopes and ethnic group, and the doctor’s feeling of being pressurised.
Conclusions: In an area of low prescribing and high expectations the decision to prescribe was closely related to actual and perceived expectations, but the latter was the more significant influence.},

	abstract = {Background.  Sharing information with patients within a consultation about their infection and value of antibiotics can help reduce antibiotic prescriptions for respiratory tract infections. However, we do not know how often information is given about antibiotics or infections, and if this is related to knowledge and attitudes.
Objectives.  To determine the public’s reported use of antibiotics, receipt of information from health professionals about antibiotics and resistance, trust in health professionals and knowledge levels about antibiotics and resistance.
Methods.  Face-to-face computer-assisted survey with 1625 adults over 15 years in randomly selected households using multistage sampling. Rim weighting was used to correct for any selection biases.
Results.  About 88\% trusted their GP to determine the need for antibiotics. Of those who took antibiotics in the past year, 62\% were for a throat infection, 60\% for sinus infection and 42\% for a cough. Although 67\% who had been prescribed an antibiotic recalled being given advice about their infection or antibiotics, only 8\% recalled information about antibiotic resistance. Those in lower social grades were less likely to recall advice. About 44\% correctly indicated that antibiotics effectively treat bacterial rather than viral infections. Only 45\% agreed that ‘healthy people can carry antibiotic resistant bacteria’.
Conclusion.  GPs and health carers are trusted decision-makers, but could share more information with patients about the need or not for antibiotics, self-care and antibiotic resistance, especially with younger patients and those of lower social grade. Better ways are needed for effective sharing of information about antibiotic resistance.},

	abstract = {Objective: Relatively little research has directly evaluated the schematic nature of illness representations proposed by the common sense model of illness. Four studies tested the hypothesis that illness schema activation leads directly and automatically to behavioral manifestations of illness. Method: Study 1 was a survey (N ϭ 970) that evaluated the proposition that the mental representation of common cold symptom experience includes functional deviation from the usual prototypical self. Studies 2 and 3 were experiments that tested effects of cold schema activation using a subliminal priming paradigm on walking speed (Study 2, N ϭ 53) and free recall in a memory task (Study 3, N ϭ 30). Study 4 (N ϭ 65) used a 2 (cold prime vs. control) ϫ 2 (alternate self vs. control) experimental design to investigate attenuation of the effect of the cold prime on free recall. Results: Study 1 confirmed the multifactorial nature of functional self-deviations representing the common cold symptomology. Studies 2 and 3 showed that participants primed with the common cold schema walked more slowly and performed worse on a memory recall task relative to controls in whom the schema was not activated. These effects were automatic in the sense that participants were not aware of the prime or of this influence. In Study 4, priming an alternative self-identity overcame the deleterious effect of automatic common cold schema activation on free recall in a memory task. Conclusions: Subliminal activation of a schematic representation of illness automatically activates behavioral manifestations of illness.},

And although retraction rates have risen in the research literature, there has been limited treatment of the process and procedures detailing how to prevent and ethically handle research errors. In response to their experience in the retraction of the “Inpatient Pediatric Psychology Consultation–Liaison Practice Survey” manuscript (Kullgren et al., 2015b), the authors make speciﬁc recommendations for the prevention, discovery, disclosure, and correction of errors in research and publication that are particularly applicable to busy clinician researchers. The authors focus on increasing awareness of risks for mistakes, ways to improve the research process, being mindful of research competencies, and creating a culture of integrity and honesty with colleagues and trainees, and provide suggestions for journal reviewers and editors.},

Aim: To study the various parameters associated with retraction of scientific articles in 2012 and 2013 and discuss the current trends in article retraction over the period of 2 years. Materials and Methods: Data were retrieved from MEDLINE (via PubMed) using the keywords retraction of articles, retraction notice, and withdrawal of article in January 2014, and analysis of articles published in 2012 and 2013 was carried out. Results: A total of 155 articles in 2012 and 182 in 2013 were retracted, and original articles followed by case reports constituted major part of it. The most cited reasons for retraction were mistakes, plagiarism, and duplicate submission, and the time interval between submission and retraction had reduced in 2013. Conclusion: Although retracted articles constitute the tip of an iceberg, they are still a matter of major concern in the scientific world. So, editors should follow the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) guidelines and make an effective strategy in order to reduce such misconduct, as it reflects very adversely not only in the scientific community but also in the general public.},

This study is a rhetorical examination of these strategies as they are reﬂected in choices in language: it compares the published retractions and letters of apology with the letters that charge misconduct. The letters are examined for any shifts in language between the charge of misconduct and the response to the charge in order to assess whether the apology was sincere or ritualistic. The results indicate that although most authors’ published acknowledgments of scientiﬁc misconduct seem to minimize culpability by means of the strategic use of language, their resulting ritualistic apologies often still satisfy in some way the accusers’ (and thus their community’s) concerns.},

The sanctity accorded to scientific research has been violated by numerous instances of research fraud, as well as deceptive and conflicted research that have seriously harmed people, subverted the evidence­base, wasted valuable resources, and undermined public trust. This deception by individuals has been fostered by the unrealistic expectations of society; facilitated by the complicity of institutions and organisations; and sanctioned by the inaction of supposed gate­keepers. Re­defining misconduct as occurring on a continuum from irresponsible to fraudulent is the first step in confronting this inconvenient truth. Implementing and evaluating multiple strategies targeting systems and individuals that promote the responsible conduct of research, rather than merely exposing serious instances of misconduct by individuals, is urgently required to restore faith in the aspirations, integrity, and results of scientific research.},

Attributable costs of retracted manuscripts, and publication output and funding of researchers found to have committed misconduct were determined. We found that papers retracted due to misconduct accounted for approximately \$58 million in direct funding by the NIH between 1992 and 2012, less than 1\% of the NIH budget over this period. Each of these articles accounted for a mean of \$392,582 in direct costs (SD \$423,256).

Participants in a debriefing condition and a no-debriefing condition learned about the scientific finding of an empirical article, whereas participants in a control condition did not. Afterward, participants in the debriefing condition were told that the article had been retracted because of fabricated data. Results showed that participants in the debriefing condition were less likely to believe in the findings than participants in the no-debriefing condition but were more likely to believe in the findings than participants in the control condition, suggesting that individuals do adjust their beliefs in the perceived truth of a scientific finding after debriefing—but insufficiently. Mediational analyses revealed that the availability of generated causal arguments underlies belief perseverance. These results suggest that a retraction note of an empirical article in a scientific journal is not sufficient to ensure that readers of the original article no longer believe in the article’s conclusions.},

	abstract = {Background: The relative importance of human diseases is conventionally assessed by cause-specific mortality, morbidity, and economic impact. Current estimates for infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria are not sufficiently supported by quantitative empirical data. This study determined the excess number of deaths, bed-days, and hospital costs associated with blood stream infections (BSIs) caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Escherichia coli (G3CREC) in 31 countries that participated in the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (EARSS).
Methods and Findings: The number of BSIs caused by MRSA and G3CREC was extrapolated from EARSS prevalence data and national health care statistics. Prospective cohort studies, carried out in hospitals participating in EARSS in 2007, provided the parameters for estimating the excess 30-d mortality and hospital stay associated with BSIs caused by either MRSA or G3CREC. Hospital expenditure was derived from a publicly available cost model. Trends established by EARSS were used to determine the trajectories for MRSA and G3CREC prevalence until 2015. In 2007, 27,711 episodes of MRSA BSIs were associated with 5,503 excess deaths and 255,683 excess hospital days in the participating countries, whereas 15,183 episodes of G3CREC BSIs were associated with 2,712 excess deaths and 120,065 extra hospital days. The total costs attributable to excess hospital stays for MRSA and G3CREC BSIs were 44.0 and 18.1 million Euros (63.1 and 29.7 million international dollars), respectively. Based on prevailing trends, the number of BSIs caused by G3CREC is likely to rapidly increase, outnumbering the number of MRSA BSIs in the near future.
Conclusions: Excess mortality associated with BSIs caused by MRSA and G3CREC is significant, and the prolongation of hospital stay imposes a considerable burden on health care systems. A foreseeable shift in the burden of antibiotic resistance from Gram-positive to Gram-negative infections will exacerbate this situation and is reason for concern.},

	abstract = {Background: To reduce the spread of antibiotic resistance, there is a pressing need for worldwide implementation of effective interventions to promote more prudent prescribing of antibiotics for acute LRTI. This study is a process analysis of the GRACE/INTRO trial of a multifactorial intervention that reduced antibiotic prescribing for acute LRTI in six European countries. The aim was to understand how the interventions were implemented and to examine effects of the interventions on general practitioners’ (GPs’) and patients’ attitudes.
Methods: GPs were cluster randomised to one of three intervention groups or a control group. The intervention groups received web-based training in either use of the C-reactive protein (CRP) test, communication skills and use of a patient booklet, or training in both. GP attitudes were measured before and after the intervention using constructs from the Theory of Planned Behaviour and a Website Satisfaction Questionnaire. Effects of the interventions on patients were assessed by a post-intervention questionnaire assessing patient enablement, satisfaction with the consultation, and beliefs about the risks and need for antibiotics.
Results: GPs in all countries and intervention groups had very positive perceptions of the intervention and the web-based training, and felt that taking part had helped them to reduce prescribing. All GPs perceived reducing prescribing as more important and less risky following the intervention, and GPs in the communication groups reported increased confidence to reduce prescribing. Patients in the communication groups who received the booklet reported the highest levels of enablement and satisfaction and had greater awareness that antibiotics could be unnecessary and harmful.
Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the interventions should be broadly acceptable to both GPs and patients, as well as feasible to roll out more widely across Europe. There are also some indications that they could help to engender changes in GP and patient attitudes that will be helpful in the longer-term, such as increased awareness of the potential disadvantages of antibiotics and increased confidence to manage LRTI without them. Given the positive effects of the booklet on patient beliefs and attitudes, it seems logical to extend the use of the patient booklet to all patients.},

We aimed to (a) provide missing causal evidence of this effect, (b) identify whether the expectations distort the perceived probability of a bacterial infection either in a preor postdecisional distortions pathway, and (c) detect possible moderators of this effect. Method: Family physicians expressed their willingness to prescribe antibiotics (Experiment 1, n1 ϭ 305) or their decision to prescribe (Experiment 2, n2 ϭ 131) and assessed the probability of a bacterial infection in hypothetical patients with infections either with low or high expectations for antibiotics. Response order of prescribing/probability was manipulated in Experiment 1. Results: Overall, the expectations for antibiotics increased intention to prescribe (Experiment 1, F(1, 301) ϭ 25.32, p Ͻ .001, ␩2p ϭ .08, regardless of the response order; Experiment 2, odds ratio [OR] ϭ 2.31, and OR ϭ 0.75, Vignettes 1 and 2, respectively). Expectations for antibiotics did not change the perceived probability of a bacterial infection (Experiment 1, F(1, 301) ϭ 1.86, p ϭ .173, ␩2p ϭ .01, regardless of the response order; Experiment 2, d ϭ Ϫ0.03, and d ϭ ϩ0.25, Vignettes 1 and 2, respectively). Physicians’ experience was positively associated with prescribing, but it did not moderate the expectations effect on prescribing. Conclusions: Patients’ and their parents’ expectations increase antibiotics prescribing, but their effect is localized—it does not leak into the perceived probability of a bacterial infection. Interventions reducing the overprescribing of antibiotics should target also psychological factors.},

Design, Setting, and Patients A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled factorial trial of 240 adults (aged Ն16 years) with acute nonrecurrent sinusitis (had Ն2 diagnostic criteria: purulent rhinorrhea with unilateral predominance, local pain with unilateral predominance, purulent rhinorrhea bilateral, presence of pus in the nasal cavity) at 58 family practices (74 family physicians) between November 2001 and November 2005. Patients were randomized to 1 of 4 treatment groups: antibiotic and nasal steroid; placebo antibiotic and nasal steroid; antibiotic and placebo nasal steroid; placebo antibiotic and placebo nasal steroid. Intervention A dose of 500 mg of amoxicillin 3 times per day for 7 days and 200 µg of budesonide in each nostril once per day for 10 days. Main Outcome Measures Proportion clinically cured at day 10 using patient symptom diaries and the duration and severity of symptoms.
Results The proportions of patients with symptoms lasting 10 or more days were 29 of 100 (29\%) for amoxicillin vs 36 of 107 (33.6\%) for no amoxicillin (adjusted odds ratio, 0.99; 95\% confidence interval, 0.57-1.73). The proportions of patients with symptoms lasting 10 or more days were 32 of 102 (31.4\%) for topical budesonide vs 33 of 105 (31.4\%) for no budesonide (adjusted odds ratio, 0.93; 95\% confidence interval, 0.54-1.62). Secondary analysis suggested that nasal steroids were significantly more effective in patients with less severe symptoms at baseline.

	abstract = {Objective: To assess three prescribing strategies for sore throat. Design: Randomised follow up study. Setting: 11 general practices in the South and West region. Subjects: 716 patients aged 4 years and over with sore throat and an abnormal physical sign in the throat; 84\% had tonsillitis or pharyngitis. Patients were randomised to three groups: prescription for antibiotics for 10 days (group 1, 246 patients); no prescription (group 2, 230 patients); or prescription for antibiotics if symptoms were not starting to settle after three days (group 3; 238 patients). Main outcome measures: Duration of symptoms; satisfaction and compliance with and perceived efficacy of antibiotics; time off school or work. Outcomes were documented in 582 subjects (81\%).
Results: Median duration of antibiotic use differed significantly in the three groups (10 v 0 v 0 days, P {\textless} 0.001); 69\% of patients in group 3 did not use their prescription. The proportion of patients better by day 3 did not differ significantly (37\% v 35\% v 30\%, P=0.28), nor did the duration of illness (median 4 v 5 v 5 days, P=0.39), days off work or school (median 2 v 2 v 1, P=0.13), or proportion of patients satisfied (96\% v 90\% v 93\%, P=0.09), although group 1 had fewer days of fever (median 1 v 2 v 2 days, P=0.04). More patients in group 1 thought the antibiotics were effective (87\% v 55\% v 60\%, P {\textless} 0.001) and intended coming to the doctor in future attacks (79\% v 54\% v 57\%, P {\textless} 0.001). “Legitimation” of illness—to explain to work or school (60\%) or family or friends (37\%)—was an important reason for consultation. Patients who were more satisfied got better more quickly, and satisfaction related strongly to how well the doctor dealt with patient’s concerns.
Conclusion: Prescribing antibiotics for sore throat only marginally affects the resolution of symptoms but enhances belief in antibiotics and intention to consult in future when compared with the acceptable strategies of no prescription or delayed prescription. Psychosocial factors are important in the decision to see a general practitioner and in predicting the duration of illness.},

	abstract = {Background Antibiotic prescribing by GPs in the UK has declined since 1995. Aim We investigated whether general practices that issue fewer antibiotic prescriptions to patients presenting with acute respiratory infections had lower consultation rates for these conditions. Design of study Retrospective data analysis. Setting UK general practice.
Method We analysed data from the General Practice Research Database, including all registered patients from 108 practices between 1995 and 2000. For each practice, numbers of consultations for acute respiratory tract infections and the proportion of consultations resulting in an antibiotic prescription were obtained. An age- and sexstandardised consultation ratio (SCR) and standardised prescription ratio (SPR) were calculated for each practice. We evaluated whether SPR and SCR values were associated.
Results For the mid-year data (1997), the crude consultation rate for all acute respiratory infections ranged from 125–1110 per 1000 registered patients at different practices; the proportion of consultations with antibiotics prescribed ranged from 45–98\%. After standardising for varying age and sex structure of practice populations, practices with lower SPR values had lower SCR values (r = 0.41; P{\textless}0.001). This association was observed in each study year. Moreover, practices that demonstrated reductions in SPR between 1995 and 2000 also showed reductions in SCR (r = 0.27; P = 0.005).
Conclusion Practices that prescribe antibiotics to a smaller proportion of patients presenting with acute respiratory infections have lower consultation rates for these conditions. Practices that succeed, over time, in reducing antibiotic prescribing also experience reductions in consultation rates for these conditions. Although our methodology cannot prove that these two findings are causally related, they imply that patients alter their illness behaviour and that this may be a response to previous consultation experience. In consequence, respiratory illness in the community may be undergoing a process of de-medicalisation.},

	title = {The reducing incidence of respiratory tract infection and its relation to antibiotic prescribing},
	abstract = {Background: There is good evidence of reduced prescribing of antibiotics in recent years, but the reason for this has not been established. Aim: To study the incidence of respiratory tract infections presenting to general practitioners (GPs) in England and Wales in relation to the incidence of other infections and to the prescription of antibiotics. Setting: Sentinel practices in England and Wales who contribute to the Weekly Returns Service (WRS) of the Royal College of General Practitioners. Design: Time-series analysis of disease incidence data reported by the practices and of antibiotic prescription data from the Prescription Pricing Authority (PPA) during the years 1994–2000.
Method: Incidence data reported weekly from 73 practices in England and Wales, serving a population of 600 000, for acute respiratory tract infections, otitis media, infectious mononucleosis, shingles, urinary tract infections, and skin infections, were consolidated into quarterly datasets and examined graphically for evidence of secular and seasonal trends. Trends in antibiotic prescription items (data for England only were supplied by the PPA) were examined for association after adjustment for seasonal variation.
Results: The incidence of respiratory tract infections and antibiotic prescribing showed virtually identical seasonal variation, with both declining from 1995: respiratory tract infections by 48\% in winter and 38\% in summer, and antibiotic prescriptions by 34\% and 21\%, respectively. Trends in both were very highly correlated. The incidence of shingles and skin infections was constant. The incidence of urinary tract infections declined by 10\%. The incidence of otitis media in children and acute bronchitis in the elderly followed the all-age trend in the reduction of respiratory tract infections.
Conclusion: The considerable reduction in the incidence of respiratory tract infections between 1995 and 2000 is the main reason for the decline in antibiotic prescribing rather than changing prescribing thresholds for antibiotics.},

Setting.—Office-based physician practices. Participants.—Physicians completing patient record forms for patients younger than 18 years. Main Outcome Measures.—Principal diagnoses and antibiotic prescriptions.
Results.—A total of 531 pediatric office visits were recorded that included a principal diagnosis of cold, URI, or bronchitis. Antibiotics were prescribed to 44\% of patients with common colds, 46\% with URIs, and 75\% with bronchitis. Extrapolating to the United States, 6.5 million prescriptions (12\% of all prescriptions for children) were written for children diagnosed as having a URI or nasopharyngitis (common cold), and 4.7 million (9\% of all prescriptions for children) were written for children diagnosed as having bronchitis. After controlling for confounding factors, antibiotics were prescribed more often for children aged 5 to 11 years than for younger children (odds ratio [OR], 1.94; 95\% conﬁdence interval [CI], 1.13-3.33) and rates were lower for pediatricians than for nonpediatricians (OR, 0.57; 95\% CI, 0.35-0.92).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Upper respiratory infections (URIs) are mainly viral in nature, rendering antibiotics ineffective. Little is known about what college students believe concerning the effectiveness of antibiotics as a treatment for URIs.
METHODS: Students (n=425) on 3 college campuses were surveyed using a survey describing 3 variations in presentation of an uncomplicated URI. Participants were questioned about their likelihood of using a variety of treatments for the URI and about their likelihood of seeking a physician’s care.
RESULTS: The percentage of students endorsing antibiotic use differed significantly by symptom complex. Likelihood of seeking medical care also differed significantly across symptom groups, with greater endorsement in the discolored nasal discharge and low­grade fever scenarios. Stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed that belief in antibiotic effectiveness for cold symptoms decreased with increasing years of higher education. Likelihood of antibiotic use across different scenarios increased with age. Likelihood of seeking care across different scenarios was related to type of health insurance and belief in antibiotic effectiveness.
CONCLUSIONS: Undergraduate college students show poor recognition of typical presentations of the common cold and have misconceptions about effective treatment. Although increasing years of college correlated with decreasing belief in antibiotics’ effectiveness for a cold, more health education at the college level is recommended.},

To analyse the variation between primary care centres (PCCs) with regard to prescribing antibiotics and to investigate whether the variation can be explained by factors related to patient satisfaction and to socio-demographic characteristics of the populations in the catchment areas of the PCCs.
Methods. The frequency of prescription of antibiotics by GPs at the PCCs was used as the dependent variable in a multivariate regression analysis. Questionnaire data for patient satisfaction and register data for socio-demographic characteristics were used as explanatory variables. The study was set in a county in south-east Sweden, and 6734 patients consulting GPs at 39 out of the 41 PCCs in the county participated. Variables correlating with the frequency of antibiotics prescription at PCC level and with patient satisfaction were the main outcome measures.
Results. A seven-fold variation in the extent of the prescription of antibiotics between the PCCs was observed. In the multivariate analysis, a high antibiotic prescription rate relates to high overall patient satisfaction with GP consultation as well as to the share of males in the listed population but to low satisfaction with the time spent by the GP on listening to the patient.
Conclusion. A high frequency of prescription of antibiotics at a PCC may reflect a general disposition among GPs to give priority to maintaining good relations with the patients. However, a low level of prescription may be consistent with patient satisfaction if more time is spent on listening to and informing the patients. Thus more time spent on listening to the patients may reduce the prescription of antibiotics without reducing patient satisfaction.},

	abstract = {Background. Acute cough with purulent sputum is a common complaint presented to general practitioners. Aim. A randomized, double blind, placebo controlled clinical trial was undertaken to determine the efficacy of doxycycline in persons aged 18 years and over presenting to 22 general practices in the Netherlands with acute cough and purulent sputum.
Method. Patients were excluded if they were pregnant, had an allergy or intolerance to tetracyclines, had severe dyspnoea and fine crackles on auscultation, purulent rhinitis together with maxillary tenderness, chronic airways disease, or had taken antibiotics in the previous two weeks. Patients entered in to the study were given oral doxycycline for 10 days, 200 mg on the first day, followed by 100 mg on the next nine days, or placebo.
Results. Duration of frequent daytime cough after entry was a mean of 1.5 days shorter in the group of 71 patients receiving doxycycline than in the group of 69 patients on placebo (4.7 days versus 6.2 days, respectively). In patients aged 55 years and over the mean duration of frequent daytime cough after entry was 4.1 days shorter in the group taking doxycycline than in the placebo group. Patients with a very frequent cough and who also felt ill at entry regained their normal daily activities 2.1 days earlier when using doxycycline than the control group.
Conclusion. Doxycycline has small beneficial effects in patients with acute cough and purulent sputum. These beneficial effects are more prominent, and probably clinically relevant, in patients aged 55 years and over and in patients who cough very frequently and who also feel ill.},

Phillips’ (1980) common sense model of illness. The present experiments tested the hypothesis that coping information is schematically encoded within the representations of a specific illness. Design: A 2 (primed vs. control) ϫ 2 (past user of coping strategy vs. nonuser of coping strategy) design was used in 2 experiments with independent samples. A subliminal prime was used to activate a common cold schema outside of conscious awareness. Main Outcome Measures: Response latencies in milliseconds for correct responses to a target common cold remedy word on a grammatical decision task served as the dependent measure in each experiment. Target words were Lemsip in Experiment 1 and lozenge in Experiment 2. Results: In each experiment, a significant interaction of Prime ϫ Past Strategy Use was obtained. Participants in whom the “common cold” schema was activated and who also reported high past strategy use demonstrated attentional bias to the name of a popular common cold remedy. Conclusion: Activation of a schematic representation of illness may automatically activate information related to coping procedures encoded in memory with the illness.},

Method. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 30 adult patients (attenders and non-attenders) from two general practices.
Results. The main themes emerging from the analysis were: perceived properties of medicines; orientation towards medicines, that is, patients' general preference for taking or not taking medication; and actual usage of medicines. The data revealed that on the one hand much medicine taking was taken for granted and on the other hand that patients had many fears and powerful negative images of medicines.
Conclusion. Any assessment of the appropriateness of a proposed treatment for an individual patient should include an exploration of his or her preferences, orientation towards medicines and social context.},

	abstract = {Objectives: Overutilisation of antibiotics may contribute to the emergence of antimicrobial drug resistance, a growing international concern. This study aimed to analyse the performance of UK general practices with respect to antibiotic prescribing for respiratory tract infections (RTIs) among young and middle-aged adults. Setting: Data are reported for 568 UK general practices contributing to the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. Participants: Participants were adults aged 18–59 years. Consultations were identified for acute upper RTIs including colds, cough, otitis-media, rhino-sinusitis and sore throat. Primary and secondary outcome measures: For each consultation, we identified whether an antibiotic was prescribed. The proportion of RTI consultations with antibiotics prescribed was estimated.
Results: There were 568 general practices analysed. The median general practice prescribed antibiotics at 54\% of RTI consultations. At the highest prescribing 10\% of practices, antibiotics were prescribed at 69\% of RTI consultations. At the lowest prescribing 10\% of practices, antibiotics were prescribed at 39\% RTI consultations. The median practice prescribed antibiotics at 38\% of consultations for ‘colds and upper RTIs’, 48\% for ‘cough and bronchitis’, 60\% for ‘sore throat’, 60\% for ‘otitis-media’ and 91\% for ‘rhinosinusitis’. The highest prescribing 10\% of practices issued antibiotic prescriptions at 72\% of consultations for ‘colds’, 67\% for ‘cough’, 78\% for ‘sore throat’, 90\% for ‘otitis-media’ and 100\% for ‘rhino-sinusitis’.
Conclusions: Most UK general practices prescribe antibiotics to young and middle-aged adults with respiratory infections at rates that are considerably in excess of what is clinically justified. This will fuel antibiotic resistance.},

Objective. The purpose of this study was to determine the associations between receiving antibiotics and information/reassurance on the one hand and patients’ satisfaction on the other in patients with acute respiratory tract symptoms, and to assess whether this relationship is influenced by patients’ expectations.
Methods. Questionnaires were distributed among patients presenting with acute respiratory tract symptoms in 51 general practices (122 GPs) in the region of Utrecht, The Netherlands. Outcome measures were patients’ expectations, GPs’ management regarding antibiotic prescribing and information/reassurance, and patient satisfaction.
Results. Information/reassurance was expected by 90\% of the respondents (916/1014); 97\% of those actually received it (888/916). Fifty percent expected antibiotics (467/926), while 73\% of them received antibiotics (343/467). Receiving information/reassurance was more strongly associated with satisfaction than an antibiotic prescription [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 10.6; 95\% confidence interval (CI) 5.6–20.1, and adjusted OR 2.2; 95\% CI 1.3–3.8, respectively]. Patients’ expectations towards antibiotics modified these associations; in patients not expecting antibiotics, receiving information/reassurance was the only independent determinant of satisfaction (adjusted OR 21.6; 95\% CI 7.4–62.7) and in patients who expected antibiotics, actually receiving antibiotics and receiving information/reassurance were equally important determinants of satisfaction (adjusted OR 3.8; 95\% CI 1.9–7.5, and adjusted OR 4.7; 95\% CI 1.9–11.9, respectively).
Conclusion. GPs should first explore patients’ expectations about antibiotic treatment before giving information about the self-limitedness of respiratory tract symptoms and (in)effectiveness of antibiotics in order to enhance shared decision making and rationalize antibiotic prescribing.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE Antibiotics are still overprescribed for self-limiting upper respiratory tract infections such as acute sore throat, and physicians mention patient’s desire for antibiotics as a driving force. We studied patients’ concerns when visiting their family physician for acute sore throat, more specifically the importance they attach to antibiotic treatment and pain relief.
METHODS Family physicians in 6 peer groups in Belgium participated in an observational postvisit questionnaire survey. Patients aged 12 years and older making an office visit for acute sore throat were invited to indicate the importance of different reasons for the visit.
RESULTS Sixty-eight family physicians provided data from 298 patients. The 3 most frequently endorsed reasons for visiting the physician were examination to establish the cause of the symptoms, pain relief, and information on the course of the disease. Hopes for an antibiotic ranked 11th of 13 items. Patients who considered antibiotics very/rather important valued pain relief significantly more than patients who considered them little/not important (P {\textless}.001). Patients who hoped for antibiotics felt more unwell (P {\textless}.001), had more faith in antibiotics to speed recovery (P {\textless}.001), and were less convinced that sore throat was a self-limiting disease (P {\textless}.012). A multivariate model, adjusted for age, sex, and educational status, showed that the desire for pain relief is a strong predictor of the hope to receive a prescription for antibiotics.
CONCLUSION Our study suggests that patients with acute sore throat and who hope for antibiotics may in fact want treatment for pain. Trials are needed to test whether exploring patients’ expectations about pain management and offering adequate analgesia can assist physicians in managing sore throats without prescribing antibiotics.},

	abstract = {Background: Antibiotic overprescription is a worldwide problem. Decisions regarding antibiotic prescription for respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are influenced by medical and non-medical factors.
Methods: In family medicine practices in Białystok, Poland, family medicine residents directly observed consultations with patients with RTI symptoms. The observing residents completed a questionnaire including patient data, clinical symptoms, diagnosis, any prescribed antibiotic, and assessment of ten patient pressure factors.
Results: Of 1546 consultations of patients with RTIs, 54.26 \% resulted in antibiotic prescription. Antibiotic prescription was strongly associated with rales (OR 26.90, 95 \% CI 9.00–80.40), tonsillar exudates (OR 13.03, 95 \% CI 7.10–23.80), and wheezing (OR 14.72, 95 \% CI 7.70–28.10). The likelihood of antibiotic prescription was increased by a {\textgreater}7-day disease duration (OR 3.94, 95 \% CI 2.80–5.50), purulent nasal discharge (OR 3.87, 95 \% CI 2.40–6.10), starting self-medication with antibiotics (OR 4.11, 95 \% CI 2.30–7.30), and direct request for antibiotics (OR 1.87, 95 \% CI 1.30–2.80). Direct request not to prescribe antibiotics decreased the likelihood of receiving antibiotics (OR 0.34, 95 \% CI 0.27–0.55).
Conclusion: While clinical signs and symptoms principally impact prescribing decisions, patient factors also contribute. The most influential patient pressure factors were starting self-medication with antibiotics, and directly requesting antibiotic prescription or no antibiotic prescription. Interventions aiming to improve clinical sign and symptom interpretation and to help doctors resist direct patient pressure could be beneficial for reducing unnecessary antibiotic prescribing.},

Consecutive patients consulting eight general practices were eligible to take part in a prospective cohort study, providing data within 3 weeks of consultation and 6 months later. Illness perceptions were measured using the Revised Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ-R). Clinical outcome was deﬁned using the Roland and Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) and patients’ global rating of change. Associations between patients, perceptions and poor outcome were analysed using unadjusted and adjusted risk ratios (RR) and 95\% conﬁdence intervals. 1591 completed questionnaires were received at baseline and 810 at 6 months. Patients had a mean age of 44 years and 59\% were women. Mean (SD) RMDQ score at baseline was 8.6 (6.0) and 6.2 (6.1) at 6 months. 52\% and 41\% of patients had a poor clinical outcome at 6 months using RMDQ and global rating scores, respectively. There were strong, statistically signiﬁcant, associations (RRs of 1.4 and over) between IPQ-R baseline consequences, timeline acute/chronic, personal control and treatment control scores and poor outcome. Patients who expected their back problem to last a long time, who perceived serious consequences, and who held weak beliefs in the controllability of their back problem were more likely to have poor clinical outcomes 6 months after they consulted their doctor. These results have implications for the management of patients, and support the need to assess and address patients’ cognitions about their back problems.},

Human factors have expanded what might otherwise have been narrow technical discussions into broad philosophical debates. There seem to be misconceptions about the requirements and capabilities of formal methods, especially in notions that certain assumptions or models (such as potential-outcome models) are necessary or sufﬁcient for valid inference. I argue that, once these misconceptions are removed, most elements of the opposing views can be reconciled. The chief problem of causal inference then becomes one of how to teach sound use of formal methods (such as causal modeling, statistical inference, and sensitivity analysis), and how to apply them without generating the overconﬁdence and misinterpretations that have ruined so many statistical practices.},

	abstract = {Background: A range of neuropathological and psychosocial factors have been implicated in the aetiology and maintenance of post-concussional syndrome (PCS), with a growing consensus in the literature that this is a complex, multifactorial condition. The role of patients’ perceptions in PCS has not been examined to date.
Objective: This longitudinal study examines the role of illness perceptions in predicting outcome following mild head injury, controlling for severity of injury, post-traumatic stress symptoms, anxiety and depression, using a logistic regression analysis.
Method: 73 patients were admitted to an accident and emergency department with mild head injury (Glasgow Coma Scale score 13–15; loss of consciousness ,20 min; posttraumatic amnesia ,24 h). Data on PCS symptomatology, illness perceptions, post-traumatic stress symptoms, anxiety and depression were collected after the injury and at the 3 month follow-up. Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate predictors of outcome.
Results: Following a mild head injury, symptomatic patients who believe that their symptoms have serious negative consequences on their lives and will continue to do so, are at heightened risk of experiencing significant enduring postconcussional symptoms (p,0.001). Adding measures of severity of injury, post-traumatic stress symptoms, anxiety and depression to the regression model did not improve prediction of outcome.
Conclusion: Whatever other physical or psychological factors may be involved, patients’ perceptions of their illness early after head injury play a part in the persistence of PCS.},

Objective.  To achieve a deeper understanding of parents’ acceptance, or otherwise, of clinicians’ antibiotic prescribing decisions for children with RTIs.
Methods.  Qualitative interviews with parents of child patients who had recently consulted in primary care with a RTI in four European countries, with a five-stage analytic framework approach (familiarization, developing a thematic framework from interview questions and emerging themes, indexing, charting and interpretation).
Results.  Fifty of 63 parents accepted clinicians’ management decisions, irrespective of antibiotic prescription. There were no notable differences between networks. Parents ascribed their acceptance to a trusting and open clinician–patient relationship, enhanced through continuity of care, in which parents felt able to express their views. There was a lack of congruence about antibiotics between parents and clinicians in 13 instances, mostly when parents disagreed about clinicians’ decision to prescribe (10 accounts) rather than objecting to withholding antibiotics (three accounts). All but one parent adhered to the prescribing decision, although some modified how the antibiotic was administered.
Conclusions.  Parents from contrasting countries indicated that continuity of care, open communication in consultations and clinician–patient trust was important in acceptance of management of RTI in their children and in motivating adherence. Interventions to promote appropriate},

	abstract = {Background: Although there is evidence of an association between antibiotic consumption and resistant bacteria on a population level, the relationship on an individual level has been less well studied, particularly in terms of nasopharyngeal colonization. We have therefore analysed this association, using data from a closely followed cohort of children taking part in a vaccination trial.
Methods: 109 children with early onset of acute otitis media (AOM) were randomised to heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) or no vaccination. They were followed for three years with scheduled appointments as well as sick visits. Nasopharyngeal cultures were obtained at all visits. Antibiotic treatments were recorded, as were risk factors for AOM, including siblings, short breastfeeding and parental smoking. Data were entered into a Cox regression model, and the ﬁndings of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus inﬂuenzae with reduced susceptibility to the penicillin group were related to the number of previous courses of antibiotics.
Results: There was evidence of an association between the amount of previously consumed betalactams and colonization with beta-lactamasenegative ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR) H. inﬂuenzae (RR 1.21; 95\% CI 1.03e1.43; p ¼ 0.03), and also with the most commonly prescribed drug; amoxicillin (RR 1.39; 95\% CI 1.09e1.76; p ¼ 0.01). There was no evidence for an association between antibiotic consumption and betalactamase producing H. inﬂuenzae or S. pneumoniae with reduced susceptibility to penicillin. Furthermore, there was no evidence of an association between resistant bacteria and AOM risk factors or PCV7.
Conclusion: In this subgroup of children, most of whom were given several courses of antibiotics in early childhood, there was evidence of an association between betalactam/amoxicillin consumption and nasopharyngeal colonization with BLNAR strains, bacteria that have increased in prevalence during the last 10e15 years, and that are notoriously difﬁcult to treat with oral antibiotics.},

	abstract = {Objective. Synthesizing research on social cognitive theories applied to health behavior is an important step in the development of an evidence base of psychological factors as targets for effective behavioral interventions. However, few meta-analyses of research on social cognitive theories in health contexts have conducted simultaneous tests of theoretically-stipulated patterns effects using path analysis. We argue that conducting path analyses of meta-analytic effects among constructs from social cognitive theories is important to test nomological validity, account for mediation effects, and evaluate unique effects of theory constructs independent of past behavior. We illustrate our points by conducting new analyses of two meta-analyses of a popular theory applied to health behaviors, the theory of planned behavior.
Method. We conducted meta-analytic path analyses of the theory in two behavioral contexts (alcohol and dietary behaviors) using data from the primary studies included in the original meta-analyses augmented to include intercorrelations among constructs and relations with past behavior missing from the original analysis.
Results. Findings supported the nomological validity of the theory and its hypotheses for both behaviors, confirmed important model processes through mediation analysis, demonstrated the attenuating effect of past behavior on theory relations, and provided estimates of the unique effects of theory constructs independent of past behavior.
Conclusions. Our analysis illustrates the importance of conducting a simultaneous test of theorystipulated effects in meta-analyses of social cognitive theories applied to health behavior. We recommend researchers adopt this analytic procedure when synthesizing evidence across primary tests of social cognitive theories in health.},

This article suggests that parents’ expectation for antibiotics is a minor factor, and health care providers’ unfounded beliefs in the effectiveness of antibiotics and exaggeration of parents’ demand for antibiotics may be the major contributing factor underlying antibiotic over-prescription for the pediatric common cold in Korea. Most physicians and pharmacists knew the correct cause of the pediatric common cold, but majorities of the physicians and pharmacists believed that antibiotics could treat and reduce its complications. On the other hand, 34\% of the parents believed that antibiotics could prevent complications. Seventy three per cent of the physicians reported that they perceived expectations for antibiotics from parents, but only 2\% of the parents reported asking their physicians for antibiotics. In summary, this study suggests that physicians’ knowledge and faulty beliefs can be more important factors for inappropriate antibiotic prescription.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE—To identify themes associated with patient perceptions of antibiotic use and the role of patients in inpatient antimicrobial stewardship. DESIGN—We conducted semi-structured interviews with 30 hospitalized patients using the Health Belief Model as the framework for questions and analysis. SETTING—An academic tertiary care hospital in Madison, Wisconsin. PARTICIPANTS—A total of 30 general medicine inpatients receiving at least 1 anti-infective medication were interviewed.
RESULTS—Participants recognized antibiotic resistance as a serious public health threat but expressed low perceived susceptibility to being personally affected by antibiotic resistance. Views of susceptibility were influenced by a high degree of trust in physicians and misperceptions regarding the mechanisms underlying resistance. Participants expressed high self-efficacy and a desire to be involved in their health care. Perceived roles for patients in preventing the inappropriate use of antibiotics ranged from asking questions and speaking up about concerns to active involvement in decision making regarding antibiotic treatments. Few participants reported being offered the opportunity to engage in such shared decision making while hospitalized.
CONCLUSIONS—Our findings suggest an important role for patients in improving antibiotic use in hospitals. However, patient engagement has not been recognized as a critical component of antimicrobial stewardship programs. Our study suggests that the likelihood of patient engagement in stewardship practices is currently limited by low perceived susceptibility and lack of cues to act. Further investigation into how patients may be engaged as good stewards of antibiotics may reveal new ways to improve antibiotic prescribing practices in the inpatient setting.},

	abstract = {Background: Inﬂuenza vaccination of healthcare workers (HCW) is important for protecting staff and patients, yet vaccine coverage among HCW remains below recommended targets. Psychological theories of behavior change may help guide interventions to improve vaccine uptake. Our objectives were to: (1) review the effectiveness of interventions based on psychological theories of behavior change to improve HCW inﬂuenza vaccination rates, and (2) determine which psychological theories have been used to predict HCW inﬂuenza vaccination uptake.
Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, The Joanna Briggs Institute, SocINDEX, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched for studies that applied psychological theories of behavior change to improve and/or predict inﬂuenza vaccination uptake among HCW.
Results: The literature search yielded a total of 1810 publications; 10 articles met eligibility criteria. All studies used behavior change theories to predict HCW vaccination behavior; none evaluated interventions based on these theories. The Health Belief Model was the most frequently employed theory to predict inﬂuenza vaccination uptake among HCW. The remaining predictive studies employed the Theory of Planned Behavior, the Risk Perception Attitude, and the Triandis Model of Interpersonal Behavior. The behavior change framework constructs were successful in differentiating between vaccinated and non-vaccinated HCW. Key constructs identiﬁed included: attitudes regarding the efﬁcacy and safety of inﬂuenza vaccination, perceptions of risk and beneﬁt to self and others, self-efﬁcacy, cues to action, and social-professional norms. The behavior change frameworks, along with sociodemographic variables, successfully predicted 85–95\% of HCW inﬂuenza vaccination uptake.
Conclusion: Vaccination is a complex behavior. Our results suggest that psychological theories of behavior change are promising tools to increase HCW inﬂuenza vaccination uptake. Future studies are needed to develop and evaluate novel interventions based on behavior change theories, which may help achieve recommended HCW vaccination targets.},

Variation in antibiotic prescribing that is not warranted by differences in illness and clinical presentation may increase selection of resistant organisms, contributing to the problem of antibiotic resistance. This study aimed to investigate clinicians’ accounts of non-clinical factors that influence their antibiotic prescribing decision for patients with LRTI, to understand variation and identify opportunities for addressing possible unhelpful variation. Design: Multicountry qualitative semistructured interview study, with data subjected to a five-stage analytic framework approach (familiarisation, developing a thematic framework from interview questions and emerging themes, indexing, charting and interpretation), and with interviewers commenting on preliminary analytic themes. Setting: Primary care. Participants: Eighty primary care clinicians randomly selected from primary care research networks based in nine European cities.
Results: Clinicians’ accounts identified non-clinical factors imposed by the healthcare system operating within specific regional primary care research networks, including patient access to antibiotics before consulting a doctor (Barcelona and Milan), systems to reduce patient expectations for antibiotics (Southampton and Antwerp) and lack of consistent treatment guidelines (Balatonfüred and Lód z). Secondly, accounts revealed factors related to specific characteristics of clinicians regardless of network ( professional ethos, self-belief in decision-making and commitment to shared decision-making).

	abstract = {Objectives: To explore and compare primary care clinicians’ perceptions of antibiotic resistance in relation to the management of community-acquired lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in contrasting European settings.
Methods: Qualitative interview study with 80 primary care clinicians in nine European countries. Data were subjected to a ﬁve-stage analytical framework approach (familiarization; developing a thematic framework from the interview questions and the themes emerging from the data; indexing; charting; and mapping to search for interpretations in the data). Preliminary analysis reports were sent to all network facilitators for validation.
Results: Most clinicians stated that antibiotic resistance was not a problem in their practice. Some recommended enhanced feedback about local resistance rates. Northern European respondents generally favoured using the narrowest-spectrum agent, motivated by containing resistance, whereas southern/eastern European respondents were more motivated by maximizing the potential of a rapid treatment effect and so justiﬁed empirical use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Antibiotic treatment failure was ascribed largely to viral aetiology rather than resistant bacteria. Clinicians generally agreed that resistance will become more serious without enhanced antibiotic stewardship or new drug discovery.
Conclusions: If current rates of antibiotic resistance are likely to result in important treatment failures, then provision of local resistance data is likely to enhance clinicians’ sense of importance of the issue. Interventions to enhance the quality of antibiotic prescribing in primary care should address perceptions, particularly in the south and east of Europe, that possible advantages to patients from antibiotic treatment in general, and from newer broad-spectrum compared with narrow-spectrum agents, outweigh disadvantages to patients and society from associated effects on antibiotic resistance.},

	abstract = {Objective: We examined how individual motivational orientations and anticipated regret are related to the protective health decision of vaccination behaviour. Design: The proposed relations were examined in a large-scale sample (N = 3168) and three medium-sized samples (N = 151, N = 194, N = 208). Questionnaires were applied to assess regulatory focus, anticipated regret and vaccination behaviour.
Results: Increased prevention-focused self-regulation – which is represented by concerns about security-related goals, responsibilities and obligations –was related to a greater likelihood of vaccination. Prevention-focused individuals’ higher likelihood of getting vaccinated seems at least in part to be a consequence of anticipated regret for not vaccinating. Study 3 suggests that regulatory focus is less related to vaccination decisions when regret is increased by the decision-making context; that is, when information highlighting vaccination effectiveness and a low likelihood of adverse responses is provided.
Conclusion: Prevention-focused self-regulation is related to a greater likelihood of engaging in health-protective behaviour. This can be explained by prevention-focused individuals’ greater tendency to anticipate regret about getting ill as a consequence of not adopting protective measures.

	abstract = {Objective To characterize the nature and completeness of informed decision making in routine office visits of both primary care physicians and surgeons. Design Cross-sectional descriptive evaluation of audiotaped office visits during 1993. Setting and Participants A total of 1057 encounters among 59 primary care physicians (general internists and family practitioners) and 65 general and orthopedic surgeons; 2 to 12 patients were recruited from each physician’s community-based private office. Main Outcome Measures Analysis of audiotaped patient-physician discussions for elements of informed decision making, using criteria that varied with the level of decision complexity: basic (eg, laboratory test), intermediate (eg, new medication), or complex (eg, procedure). Criteria for basic decisions included discussion of the nature of the decision and asking the patient to voice a preference; other categories had criteria that were progressively more stringent.
Results The 1057 audiotaped encounters contained 3552 clinical decisions. Overall, 9.0\% of decisions met our definition of completeness for informed decision making. Basic decisions were most often completely informed (17.2\%), while no intermediate decisions were completely informed, and only 1 (0.5\%) complex decision was completely informed. Among the elements of informed decision making, discussion of the nature of the intervention occurred most frequently (71\%) and assessment of patient understanding least frequently (1.5\%).
Conclusions Informed decision making among this group of primary care physicians and surgeons was often incomplete. This deficit was present even when criteria for informed decision making were tailored to expect less extensive discussion for decisions of lower complexity. These findings signal the need for efforts to encourage informed decision making in clinical practice.},

	abstract = {Background: Over-use of antibiotics for acute respiratory infections (ARIs) increases antimicrobial resistance, treatment costs, and side effects. Patient desire for antibiotics contributes to over-use.
Objective: To explore whether a point-of-care interactive computerized education module increases patient knowledge and decreases desire for antibiotics.
Methods: Bilingual (English/Spanish) interactive kiosks were available in 8 emergency departments as part of a multidimensional intervention to reduce antibiotic prescribing for ARIs. The symptom-tailored module included assessment of symptoms, knowledge about ARIs (3 items), and desire for antibiotics on a 10-point visual analog scale. Multivariable analysis assessed predictors of change in desire for antibiotics.
Results: Of 686 adults with ARI symptoms, 63\% initially thought antibiotics might help. The proportion of patients with low (1–3 on the scale) desire for antibiotics increased from 22\% pre-module to 49\% postmodule (p {\textless} .001). Self-report of ‘‘learning something new’’ was associated with decreased desire for antibiotics, after adjusting for baseline characteristics (p = .001).
Conclusion: An interactive educational kiosk improved knowledge about antibiotics and ARIs. Learning correlated with changes in personal desire for antibiotics. Practice implications: By reducing desire for antibiotics, point-of-care interactive educational computer technology may help decrease inappropriate use for antibiotics for ARIs. ß 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

	abstract = {Background Antibiotic use and concomitant resistance are increasing. Literature reviews do not unambiguously indicate which interventions are most effective in improving antibiotic prescribing practice. Aim To assess the effectiveness of physician-targeted interventions aiming to improve antibiotic prescribing for respiratory tract infections (RTIs) in primary care, and to identify intervention features mostly contributing to intervention success. Design and setting Analysis of a set of physician-targeted interventions in primary care.
Method A literature search (1990–2009) for studies describing the effectiveness of interventions aiming to optimise antibiotic prescription for RTIs by primary care physicians. Intervention features were extracted and effectiveness sizes were calculated. Association between intervention features and intervention success was analysed in multivariate regression analysis.
Results This study included 58 studies, describing 87 interventions of which 60\% significantly improved antibiotic prescribing; interventions aiming to decrease overall antibiotic prescription were more frequently effective than interventions aiming to increase first choice prescription. On average, antibiotic prescription was reduced by 11.6\%, and first choice prescription increased by 9.6\%. Multiple interventions containing at least ‘educational material for the physician’ were most often effective. No significant added value was found for interventions containing patientdirected elements. Communication skills training and near-patient testing sorted the largest intervention effects.
Conclusion This review emphasises the importance of physician education in optimising antibiotic use. Further research should focus on how to provide physicians with the relevant knowledge and tools, and when to supplement education with additional intervention elements. Feasibility should be included in this process.},

Method: Qualitative semi-structured interview study with 32 women and 14 men, selected by both purposive and theoretical sampling, from areas of high, average and low deprivation.
Results: Respondents were highly conﬁdent about the efﬁcacy and safety of antibiotics. Reported respondent antibiotic user behaviours fell into six types, those that: (1) always took antibiotics as prescribed; (2) could not take doses because of work, child care, or social constraints; (3) frequently forgot doses; (4) believed it made sense to stop taking antibiotics as they started to get better; (5) actively sought to limit antibiotic use because they believed their own bodies became used to them or because antibiotics are ‘unnatural’; and (6) deliberately planned to stop early so as to have an antibiotic supply for self use in the future to avoid the challenges of consulting and obtaining antibiotics in primary care.
Conclusion: Members of the public are conﬁdent about the safety and efﬁcacy of antibiotics. Most report taking antibiotics as prescribed, but there is a range of other unintentional and intentional characteristic non-adherent behaviours that require different solutions.},

Design  Primary care feasibility cluster randomised controlled trial. Setting  32 general practices in South West England recruiting children from October 2014 to April 2015. Participants  Children (aged 3 months to {\textless}12 years) with acute cough and respiratory tract infection (RTI). Intervention  A web-based clinician-focussed clinical rule to predict risk of future hospitalisation and a printed leaflet with individualised child health information for carers, safety-netting advice and a treatment decision record. Controls  Usual practice, with clinicians recording data on symptoms, signs and treatment decisions.
Results  Of 542 children invited, 501 (92.4\%) consented to participate, a month ahead of schedule. Antibiotic prescribing data were collected for all children, follow-up data for 495 (98.8\%) and the National Health Service resource use data for 494 (98.6\%). The overall antibiotic prescribing rates for children’s RTIs were 25\% and 15.8\% (p=0.018) in intervention and control groups, respectively. We found evidence of postrandomisation differential recruitment: the number of children recruited to the intervention arm was higher (292 vs 209); over half were recruited by prescribing nurses compared with less than a third in the control arm; children in the intervention arm were younger (median age 2 vs 3 years controls, p=0.03) and appeared to be more unwell than those in the control arm with higher respiratory rates (p{\textless}0.0001), wheeze prevalence (p=0.007) and global illness severity scores assessed by carers (p=0.045) and clinicians (p=0.01). Interviews with clinicians confirmed preferential recruitment of less unwell children to the trial, more so in the control arm.

	abstract = {Objectives. To investigate the views of parents, clinicians, and children pertaining to prescribing decisions for acute childhood infection in primary care. Methods. A systematic review of qualitative studies. Meta-ethnographic methods were used, with data drawn from the primary studies in an interpretive analysis. Results. A total of 15 studies met the inclusion criteria. The literature was dominated by concerns about antibiotic over-prescription. Children’s views were not reported. Clinicians prescribed antibiotics when they felt pressured by parents or others (e.g. employers) to do so, when they believed there was a clear clinical indication, but also when they felt uncertain of clinical or social outcomes they prescribed “just in case”. Parents wanted antibiotics when they felt they would improve the current illness, and when they felt pressure from daycare providers or employers. Clinicians avoided antibiotics when they were concerned about adverse reactions or drug resistance, when certain they were not indicated, and when there was no perceived pressure from parents. Parents also wished to avoid adverse effects of antibiotics, and did not want antibiotics when they would not relieve current symptoms. Some parents preferred to avoid medication altogether. Within paediatric consultations, parents sought a medical evaluation and decision. Primary care clinicians want satisﬁed parents and short consultations. Conclusions. Antibiotic prescriptions for childhood infections in primary care often result from “just in case” prescribing. These ﬁndings suggest that interventions which reduce clinician uncertainty regarding social or clinical outcomes and provide strategies to meet parents’ needs within a short consultation are most likely to reduce antibiotic prescribing.},

Future campaigns that are aimed at reducing the level of prescribing should be focused towards those more likely to be prescribed antibiotics at present: younger women and those with a lower level of education. They should also examine and consider modifying consultation behaviour and other behavioural components involved in patient’ expectations for antibiotics. This should include delayed antibiotic prescriptions. The easiest way to reduce the use of leftovers may be to shorten the course of antibiotics prescribed to 3 or 5 days. We should also promote a ‘Do not recycle antibiotics’ message towards the more highly educated, young women who are more likely to store, take and share antibiotics without advice.},

	abstract = {Objective: To assess the medicalising effect of prescribing antibiotics for sore throat Setting: 11 general practices in England. Design: Randomised trial of three approaches to sore throat: a 10 day prescription of antibiotics, no antibiotics, or a delayed prescription if the sore throat had not started to setde after three days. Patients: 716 patients aged 4 and over with sore throat and an abnormal physical sign: 84\% had tonsillitis or pharyngitis. Outcome measures: Number and rate of patients making a first return with sore throat, pharyngitis, or tonsillitis. Early returns (within two weeks) and complications (otitis media, sinusitis, quinsy). Outcomes were documented in 675 subjects (94\%).
Results: Mean follow up time was similar (antibiotic group 1.07 years, other two groups 1.03 years). More of those initially prescribed antibiotics initially returned to the surgery with sore throat (38\% v 27\%, adjusted hazard ratio for return 1.39,95\% confidence interval 1.03 to 1.89). Antibiotics prescribed for sore throat during the previous year had an additional effect (hazard ratio 1.69, 1.20 to 2.37). Longer duration of illness ( {\textgreater} 5 days) was associated with increased return within six weeks (hazard ratio 2.90, 1.70 to 4.92). Prior attendance with upper respiratory conditions was also associated with increased reattendance. There was no difference between groups in early return (13/238 (5.5\%) v 27/437 (6\%)), or complications (2/236 (0.8\%) v 3/434 (0.7\%)).
Conclusions: Complications and early return resulting from no or delayed prescribing of antibiotics for sore throat are rare. Both current and previous prescribing for sore throat increase reattendance. To avoid medicalising a self limiting illness doctors should avoid antibiotics or offer a delayed prescription for most patients with sore throat},

	title = {Reducing reconsultations for acute lower respiratory tract illness with an information leaflet: a randomized controlled study of patients in primary care},
	abstract = {Background. General practitioners (GPs) prescribe antibiotics to three-quarters of patients who consult with a lower respiratory tract illness (LRTi). In spite of this management, around a quarter of patients reconsult for the same symptoms within a month. Aim. To investigate the impact of providing a simple leaflet regarding the natural history of lower respiratory tract symptoms on reconsultation rates for previously well adults presenting to their GP with an LRTi.
Method. Seventy-six GPs studied 1014 previously well adults presenting with an illness defined as an LRTi. Management was left to the GP's discretion. Half of the patients were randomly allocated to receive an information leaflet at the end of the consultation, blinded from the GP. The endpoint was reconsultation for the same symptoms within one month.
Results. Follow-up data was available for 1006 adults, of whom 182 (18\%) reconsulted. Fewer patients who received the leaflet (75/505; 14.9\%) returned to the surgery compared with those who did not (107/501; 21.4\%; P = 0.007). The same benefit was found for the 723 (72\%) adults treated initially with antibiotics; 16\% (60/369) in the leaflet group returned compared with 23\% (81/354) in the no leaflet group (P = 0.02).
Conclusion. Informing previously well patients about the natural history of LRTi symptoms is an effective strategy for reducing reconsultations, benefiting the patient and the GP; it is likely to reduce antibiotic prescriptions and future patient consultation habits.},

	abstract = {Inappropriate prescription has been associated with mounting rates of antibiotic resistance worldwide, demanding more detailed studies into physicians’ decision-making process. Accordingly, this study sought to explore physicians’ perceptions of factors inﬂuencing antibiotic prescribing. A systematic search was performed for qualitative studies focused on understanding physicians’ perceptions of the factors, attitudes and knowledge inﬂuencing antibiotic prescription. Of the total of 35 papers selected for review purposes, 18 solely included physicians and the remaining 17 also included patients and/or other healthcare providers. Data collection was based mainly on interviews, followed by questionnaires and focus groups, and the methodologies mainly used for data analysis were grounded theory and thematic analysis. Factors cited by physicians as having an impact on antibiotic prescribing were grouped into those that were intrinsic (group 1) and those that were extrinsic (group 2) to the healthcare professional. Among the former, physicians’ attitudes, such as complacency or fear, were rated as being most inﬂuential on antibiotic prescribing, whilst patient-related factors (e.g. signs and symptoms) or healthcare system-related factors (e.g. time pressure and policies/guidelines implemented) were the most commonly reported extrinsic factors. These ﬁndings revealed that: (i) antibiotic prescribing is a complex process inﬂuenced by factors affecting all the actors involved, including physicians, other healthcare providers, healthcare system, patients and the general public; and (ii) such factors are mutually dependent. Hence, by shedding new light on the process, these ﬁndings will hopefully contribute to generating new and more effective strategies for improving antibiotic prescribing and allaying global concern about antibiotic resistance.},

	abstract = {Background Antibiotic resistance is one of the principal public health problems worldwide. Currently, inappropriate use of antibiotics is regarded as the principal determinant of resistance, with most of these drugs being prescribed outside a hospital setting. This systematic review sought to identify the factors, attitudes and knowledge linked to misprescription of antibiotics.
Methods A systematic review was conducted using the MEDLINE-PubMed and EMBASE databases. The selection criteria required that papers: (1) be published in English or Spanish; (2) designate their objective as that of addressing attitudes/ knowledge or other factors related with the prescribing of antibiotics; and (3) use quality and/or quantity indicators to deﬁne misprescription. The following were excluded: any paper that used qualitative methodology and any paper that included descriptive analysis only.
Results A total of 46 papers that met the inclusion criteria were included in the review. They were very heterogeneous and displayed major methodological limitations. Doctors’ socio-demographic and personal factors did not appear to exert much inﬂuence. Complacency (fulﬁlling what professionals perceived as being patients’/parents’ expectations) and, to a lesser extent, fear (fear of possible complications in the patient) were the attitudes associated with misprescription of antibiotics.
Conclusions Before designing interventions aimed at improving the prescription and use of antibiotics, studies are needed to identify precisely which factors inﬂuence prescribing.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies have not addressed whether cultural factors influence beliefs and practices related to the treatment of upper respiratory infections (URIs). The purpose of our project was to assess beliefs, care-seeking behavior, use of antibiotics, and means of obtaining antibiotics for the treatment of URIs among different ethnic groups in an urban community.
METHODS: A total of 192 adults completed a self-administered questionnaire indicating their likelihood of seeking care, the perceived effectiveness of treatment methods, and their usual use of treatment regimens for 2 scenarios consistent with uncomplicated URIs. Respondents were also asked about their use of antibiotics not prescribed by a physician for a URI.
RESULTS: A majority of subjects reported a belief in the effectiveness of antibiotics for URIs and indicated they are likely to seek care for URIs. Many (26\%) had obtained antibiotics from sources other than a physician’s prescription (eg, directly from pharmacists or a supplier outside the United States). Many (31\%) believed that antibiotics should be available over the counter. Individuals who reported using antibiotics for a URI were more likely than those who did not to obtain them without a prescription (35\% vs 11\%, P = .001). Subjects with a cultural background from countries where antibiotics are available over the counter are more likely to use antibiotics not prescribed by a physician than those from countries with variably enforced regulations or the United States (40\%, 30\%, and 20\%, respectively, P = .049).
CONCLUSIONS: Members of an ethnically diverse community believe antibiotics are effective for colds, are very likely to seek care for colds, and often obtain antibiotics without a prescription. The ease of antibiotic access worldwide may influence their use in some communities in the United States.},

	abstract = {Background: Cytology often is used to obtain a diagnosis, such as that of malignant neoplasia. When a diagnosis is uncertain, pathologists often express probability using qualitative terms, such as ‘‘probable,’’ that have imprecise meanings. Hypothesis: Terms expressing probability are interpreted variably by veterinary practitioners and affect decisions regarding treatment and euthanasia. Animals: None.
Methods: An online survey of members of the Veterinary Information Network was conducted. Veterinarians were asked to assign percentage probabilities to 18 modiﬁers of a diagnosis of lymphoma. They also were asked to select their most likely clinical action based on a diagnosis of lymphoma qualiﬁed one of 4 modiﬁers. Results were analyzed using descriptive and nonparametric methods. Percentage probabilities were analyzed by ANOVA after variance stabilization.
Results: For 871 valid surveys, probabilities assigned to the 18 modiﬁers overlapped substantially, with medians (interquartile range) of 50\% (50–70\%) for ‘‘possible,’’ 66\% (66–85\%) for ‘‘probable,’’ and 70\% (70–90\%) for ‘‘consistent with.’’ More (P o .001) veterinarians (50.4\%) chose to initiate treatment with a diagnosis of ‘‘consistent with lymphoma’’ as compared with ‘‘probable’’ (14.6\%) or ‘‘possible’’ (1.6\%) lymphoma. For clients considering euthanasia if the diagnosis was cancer, more (P o .001) veterinarians recommended euthanasia with a diagnosis of ‘‘consistent with lymphoma’’ (62.5\%) as compared with ‘‘probable’’ (35.3\%), or ‘‘possible’’ (2.0\%) lymphoma.
Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Probability expressions are interpreted variably yet have a major impact on clinical decision-making, including the decision to recommend euthanasia. Standardized terminology could improve decision-making and enhance clinical outcome.},

We asked whether sociability predicts resistance to infectious disease and whether this relationship is attributable to the quality and quantity of social interactions and relationships. Three hundred thirty-four volunteers completed questionnaires assessing their sociability, social networks, and social supports, and six evening interviews assessing daily interactions. They were subsequently exposed to a virus that causes a common cold and monitored to see who developed veriﬁable illness. Increased sociability was associated in a linear fashion with a decreased probability of developing a cold. Although sociability was associated with more and higher-quality social interactions, it predicted disease susceptibility independently of these variables. The association between sociability and disease was also independent of baseline immunity (virus-speciﬁc antibody), demographics, emotional styles, stress hormones, and health practices.},

	abstract = {Multiple lines of research indicate that fathers often treat boys and girls differently in ways that impact child outcomes. The complex picture that has emerged, however, is obscured by methodological challenges inherent to the study of parental caregiving, and no studies to date have examined the possibility that gender differences in observed real-world paternal behavior are related to differential paternal brain responses to male and female children. Here we compare fathers of daughters and fathers of sons in terms of naturalistically observed everyday caregiving behavior and neural responses to child picture stimuli. Compared with fathers of sons, fathers of daughters were more attentively engaged with their daughters, sang more to their daughters, used more analytical language and language related to sadness and the body with their daughters, and had a stronger neural response to their daughter’s happy facial expressions in areas of the brain important for reward and emotion regulation (medial and lateral orbitofrontal cortex [OFC]). In contrast, fathers of sons engaged in more rough and tumble play (RTP), used more achievement language with their sons, and had a stronger neural response to their son’s neutral facial expressions in the medial OFC (mOFC). Whereas the mOFC response to happy faces was negatively related to RTP, the mOFC response to neutral faces was positively related to RTP, specifically for fathers of boys. These results indicate that real-world paternal behavior and brain function differ as a function of child gender.},

	title = {Regional variation in nonmedical factors affecting family physicians’ decisions about referral for consultation},
	abstract = {Objective: To determine whether there is regional variation in environmental (nonmedical) factors affecting referral decisions of family physicians (FPs). Design: Cross-sectional interview survey. Setting: Nova Scotia. Participants: A random sample of 125 FPs grouped into 1 of 5 functionally defined geographic regions of Nova Scotia (25 in each group). Groupings were based on access to general hospital beds through active staff hospital appointments or to specialist consultants in the community, or both. Participants were personally interviewed on site. No physician refused an interview. In 9 cases the physician indicated that he or she did not fit the profile of the assigned group; the physician was excluded from the study and the next doctor on the list was substituted. Outcome measures: The questionnaire was designed to test several hypotheses about factors known to potentially influence decisions about referral. Geographic differences in factors affecting referral and in decisions about 5 hypothetical cases were assessed with the use of significance tests for proportions that were sensitive to specific orders across groups.
Results: Three factors affecting referral showed unequivocal variation across the 5 groups. Access to hospital facilities and remoteness from specialist care, leading to local styles of practice or treatment policies, and the FP’s relationship with specialist consultants appeared to be important nonmedical factors affecting referral decisions. For similar case scenarios the physicians living in rural areas would refer only half as often overall as those living in urban areas with tertiary care hospitals; for some cases, such as a severe asthma attack, the difference was more than 7-fold.
Conclusions: Significant differences in nonmedical factors affecting referral, and in referral decisions about hypothetical cases, were found between the groups of FPs. Differences in access to resources, creating local styles of practice, appeared to explain most of the variation. The results may account for previously observed differences in actual rates of referral for these particular groups.},

	abstract = {There is increasing concern that most current published research ﬁndings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientiﬁc ﬁeld. In this framework, a research ﬁnding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a ﬁeld are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater ﬂexibility in designs, deﬁnitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater ﬁnancial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientiﬁc ﬁeld in chase of statistical signiﬁcance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientiﬁc ﬁelds, claimed research ﬁndings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

	abstract = {Objecti7e – To describe general practitioners’ (GPs) prescribing patterns for antibiotics and to compare them with therapeutic guidelines. Design – Cross-sectional, observational study. Setting – In the Norwegian county Møre \& Romsdal the GPs recorded all contacts with patients and prescriptions during two months. Subjects – 69843 contacts with 56758 prescriptions, of which 7905 were for systemic antibiotics. Main outcome measures – Prescriptions in relation to diagnosis, kind of consultation, and patients’ age and sex. Results – 61\% of all antibiotic prescriptions were for females, 26\% were issued during indirect contacts, and 14\% were repeat prescriptions. Phenoxymethylpenicillin was prescribed most frequently (32\%), followed by co-trimoxazole (19\%), tetracyclines (18\%), erythromycin (16\%), and penicillins with extended spectrum (6\%). Urinary tract infection was the most frequent diagnosis for antibiotic prescribing (24\%), followed by acute bronchitis (13\%), ear infections (9\%), upper respiratory tract infections (8\%), and acute tonsillitis (8.2\%). A regression analysis showed that ﬁrst-time consultations for tonsillitis and otitis, but not for acute bronchitis and pneumonia, patient age 13 – 64 years, female physician, urban practice location, and a ﬁxed GP salary were associated with the prescribing of phenoxymethylpenicillin in contrast to other antibiotics. Conclusion – Antibiotics are often prescribed for viral infections (e.g. acute bronchitis). Broad spectrum antibiotics are often prescribed for diagnoses where penicillin is recommended as ﬁrst choice. The issue of antibiotic misuse should be addressed more explicitly in general practice.},

We suggest that risk quantiﬁers can also serve the speaker’s interest by decreasing the chance of being blamed for an incorrect wrongful prediction (i.e., speaker-face-management device). In ﬁve experiments, we investigate how individuals interpret risk quantiﬁers and the effect of their interpretations on risk perception. Results show that speaker-face-management is the most frequent interpretation in both negative and positive outcome predictions, for different probability terms, and in different cultures. Results consistently show that device interpretation determines risk judgment, negativity perceptions and decision making.

Methods: Participants were 20 fifth graders, 54 seventh graders, 45 ninth graders, and 34 young adults (mean adult age ؍ 26.24 years, standard deviation ؍ 2.09) from the San Francisco Bay area. They completed a selfadministered survey asking them to assign percentage estimates (0\% to 100\%) to 30 randomly ordered probability terms.
Results: Significant age differences in the mean percentage estimates for 8 of the 30 terms were shown. Moreover, we found large variation in the interpretation of most probability terms studied, with larger variation among the adolescents than adults. Finally, all age groups had some difficulty correctly differentiating between “possibly” and “probably.”
Conclusions: Owing to wide variation in the interpretation of probability terms, both within and across age groups, we suggest health practitioners use percentages rather than probability terms to convey risk to both adolescents and adults. © Society for Adolescent Medicine, 2000},

The more severe the condition, the greater the chance that the listener construes the expression as a politeness marker rather than as an uncertainty marker. When this misconception does not occur, neither should the severity bias. An analysis of interpretations of probability expressions using a membership-function approach validates this account.

We report two experiments testing our hypotheses that (a) the direction of a phrase can be predicted from properties of its membership function, and (b) this relation is invariant across contexts, and (c) —originally formulated by Teigen and Brun (1999)—that strong modiﬁers intensify phrase directionality. For each phrase, participants encoded membership functions by judging the degree to which it described the numerical probabilities 0.0, 0.1, . . . , 1.0, and also completed sentences including the target phrase. The types of reasons given in the sentence completion task were used to determine the phrase’s directionality. The results support our hypotheses (a) and (b) regarding the relation between directionality and the membership functions, but we found only limited support for hypothesis (c) regarding the effects of modiﬁers on directionality.

Design Qualitative study based on focus group discussions. Setting General practice vocational training schemes in South Wales. Participants 39 general practice registrars and eight course organisers attended four sessions; three simulated patients attended each time.
Method Registrars consulting with simulated patients used verbal or “qualitative” descriptions of risks, then numerical data, and finally graphical presentations of the same data. Responses of doctors and patients were explored by semistructured discussions that had been audiotaped for transcription and analysis.
Results The process of using risk communication tools in simulated consultations was acceptable to general practitioner registrars. Providing doctors with information about risks and benefits of treatment options was generally well received. Both doctors and patients found it helped communication. There were concerns about the lack of available, unbiased, and applicable evidence and a shortage of time in the consultation to discuss treatment options adequately. Graphical presentation of information was often favoured—an approach that also has the potential to save consultation time.
Conclusions A range of risk communication “tools” with which to discuss treatment options is likely to be more applicable than a single new strategy. These tools should include both absolute and relative risk information formats, presented in an unbiased way. Using risk communication tools in simulated consultations provides a model for training in risk communication for professional groups.},

The IPCC assessment reports have been published in six languages, but the consistency of the interpretation of these words crossculturally has yet to be investigated. In two studies, we find considerable variation in the interpretation of the IPCC’s probability expressions between the Chinese and British public. Whilst British interpretations differ somewhat from the IPCC’s prescriptions, Chinese interpretations differ to a much greater degree and show more variation. These results add weight to continuing calls for the IPCC to make greater use of numbers in its forecasts.},

	abstract = {Objective: To assess whether the type of scale used (scaling effects) and the severity of outcome (outcome severity) influence patients' numerical interpretations of verbal probability expressions. Design: Cross-sectional survey of patients in a general medicine clinic. Setting: A university-based Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Participants: 210 patients seen consecutively in a general medicine clinic.
Measurements and results: The patients were randomized to scale and health outcome (complications of surgery). Two scales (a long form and a short form) were used to expressly allow patients to choose probabilities less than 1\%. The long form had a lower bound of "{\textless} 1 out of 1,000,000"; the short form had a lower bound of "{\textless} 1 out of 1,000." Two complications were used: "'death from anesthesia" and "severe pneumonia." In the context of being told that their surgeon believed that the chance the complication would occur was "rare," patients were asked to give the numerical estimate of that chance. The values elicited on both scales were significantly different for the two outcomes, with the "rare" risk of death from anesthesia being characterized as less likely than the "rare" risk of severe pneumonia (F = 5.24, p = 0.023). Linear regression and three-factor analysis of variance shnwed significant differences in the probabilities elicited for scale, outcome, and age, with older patients generally responding with higher probabilities than did younger patients.
Conclusions: These findings suggest that the severity of the associated outcome and the scale used to elicit patients' numerical estimates nf verbal probability expressions itffluence patients' quantitative interpretations of the verbal probability statement; and older patients respond with higher probabilities of negative outcomes than do younger patients. Future studies must continue to explore whether verbal probability expressions are adequate for communicating medical risk to patients or whether patients should be provided with numerical estimates of frequency.},

	abstract = {Background. Patients and physicians often communicate using qualitative probability expressions that describe expected outcomes or risks of a medical intervention without knowing whether or not they share the same understanding.
Objective. The aim of the present study was to determine interpretations of qualitative probability expressions in clinical settings by Japanese patients and physicians as well as their assessments and preferences about physicians’ use of such expressions.
Methods. One hundred and sixty-eight consecutive patients aged 16 years or older, who attended a university hospital during a 2-week period in 1999, and 156 physicians recruited through the Japanese General Medicine Research Network participated in this cross-sectional survey, using a self-administered questionnaire. Participants were asked to assign numerical interpretations as a percentage to 10 qualitative expressions of probability in two clinical situations related to prescribing a medicine for a cold and an anti-cancer drug. They were also asked which type of expression, qualitative or quantitative, they usually use when communicating probabilistic clinical information and which they prefer.
Results. The estimates of probability expressions showed wide variations, especially among patients. Patients tended to assign lower and higher values to highly positive and negative probability expressions, respectively, than physicians. Clinical context also influenced the estimation: both groups tended to assign higher estimates in the anti-cancer drug situation than in the cold treatment situation. Factor analysis revealed three psychologically meaningful factors in each situation. More patients than physicians (64.6\% versus 50.3\%) thought that physicians do not use numbers in routine practice. More than 20\% of both patients and physicians considered that the actual use of qualitative terms by physicians is undesirable. Nevertheless, a sizable number of patients (41.4\%) and physicians (15.2\%) considered it preferable that physicians do not use numbers.
Conclusion. Since interpretation of qualitative expressions of probability in Japanese is subject to large interpersonal variability and differences between patients and physicians, as well as context dependence, the use of qualitative expressions alone might cause misunderstanding among the parties involved. However, the majority of patients prefer words to numbers at present. Therefore, physicians, at least in Japan, ought to provide patients with both numbers and words when critical decisions need to be communicated.},

	abstract = {We discuss three arguments voiced by scientists who view the current outpouring of concern about replicability as overblown. The first idea is that the adoption of a low alpha level (e.g., 5\%) puts reasonable bounds on the rate at which errors can enter the published literature, making false-positive effects rare enough to be considered a minor issue. This, we point out, rests on statistical misunderstanding: The alpha level imposes no limit on the rate at which errors may arise in the literature (Ioannidis, 2005b). Second, some argue that whereas direct replication attempts are uncommon, conceptual replication attempts are common—providing an even better test of the validity of a phenomenon. We contend that performing conceptual rather than direct replication attempts interacts insidiously with publication bias, opening the door to literatures that appear to confirm the reality of phenomena that in fact do not exist. Finally, we discuss the argument that errors will eventually be pruned out of the literature if the field would just show a bit of patience. We contend that there are no plausible concrete scenarios to back up such forecasts and that what is needed is not patience, but rather systematic reforms in scientific practice.},

One topic receiving substantial attention is the role of replication in psychological science. Using the complete publication history of the 100 psychology journals with the highest 5-year impact factors, the current article provides an overview of replications in psychological research since 1900. This investigation revealed that roughly 1.6\% of all psychology publications used the term replication in text. A more thorough analysis of 500 randomly selected articles revealed that only 68\% of articles using the term replication were actual replications, resulting in an overall replication rate of 1.07\%. Contrary to previous findings in other fields, this study found that the majority of replications in psychology journals reported similar findings to their original studies (i.e., they were successful replications). However, replications were significantly less likely to be successful when there was no overlap in authorship between the original and replicating articles. Moreover, despite numerous systemic biases, the rate at which replications are being published has increased in recent decades.},

I argue that this crisis follows the failure of widely adopted solutions to psychology’s similar crisis of the 1970s. The untouched root cause is an information-economic one: Too many studies divided by too few publication outlets equals a bottleneck. Articles cannot pass through just by showing theoretical meaning and methodological rigor; their results must appear to support the hypothesis perfectly. Consequently, psychologists must master the art of presenting perfect-looking results just to survive in the profession. This favors aesthetic criteria of presentation in a way that harms science’s search for truth. Shallow standards of statistical perfection distort analyses and undermine the accuracy of cumulative data; narrative expectations encourage dishonesty about the relationship between results and hypotheses; criteria of novelty suppress replication attempts. Concerns about truth in research are emerging in other sciences and may eventually descend on our heads in the form of difficult and insensitive regulations. I suggest a more palatable solution: to open the bottleneck, putting structures in place to reward broader forms of information sharing beyond the exquisite art of present-day journal publication.},

We report a content analysis of the method section of experiments reported in two psychology journals (Psychological Science and the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology), focusing on aspects of the procedure associated with these two phenomena, such as mention of the presence of the experimenter, suspicion probing, and handling of deception. We note that such information is very often absent, which prevents observers from gauging the extent to which such factors influence the results. We consider the reasons that may explain this omission, including the automatization of psychology experiments, the evolution of research topics, and, most important, a view of research participants as passive receptacles of stimuli. Using a situated social cognition perspective, we emphasize the importance of integrating the social context of experiments in the explanation of psychological phenomena. We illustrate this argument via a controversy on stereotype-based behavioral priming effects.},

	abstract = {Like other scientists, psychologists believe experimental replication to be the final arbiter for determining the validity of an empirical finding. Reports in psychology journals often attempt to prove the validity of a hypothesis or theory with multiple experiments that replicate a finding. Unfortunately, these efforts are sometimes misguided because in a field like experimental psychology, ever more successful replication does not necessarily ensure the validity of an empirical finding. When psychological experiments are analyzed with statistics, the rules of probability dictate that random samples should sometimes be selected that do not reject the null hypothesis, even if an effect is real. As a result, it is possible for a set of experiments to have too many successful replications. When there are too many successful replications for a given set of experiments, a skeptical scientist should be suspicious that null or negative findings have been suppressed, the experiments were run improperly, or the experiments were analyzed improperly. This article describes the implications of this observation and demonstrates how to test for too much successful replication by using a set of experiments from a recent research paper.},

He then argues that, because of this, our findings should be discounted. We propose that, instead of engaging in a statistical fishing expedition, Francis should have simply asked us for our file drawer. If he had done so, he would have quickly realized that a meta-analysis of all our studies (both published and unpublished) shows that the effect we reported is highly reliable. We suggest that when the answer is out there, it makes more sense to ask for it than to estimate it.},

	abstract = {The ability to self-correct is considered a hallmark of science. However, self-correction does not always happen to scientific evidence by default. The trajectory of scientific credibility can fluctuate over time, both for defined scientific fields and for science at-large. History suggests that major catastrophes in scientific credibility are unfortunately possible and the argument that “it is obvious that progress is made” is weak. Careful evaluation of the current status of credibility of various scientific fields is important in order to understand any credibility deficits and how one could obtain and establish more trustworthy results. Efficient and unbiased replication mechanisms are essential for maintaining high levels of scientific credibility. Depending on the types of results obtained in the discovery and replication phases, there are different paradigms of research: optimal, self-correcting, false nonreplication, and perpetuated fallacy. In the absence of replication efforts, one is left with unconfirmed (genuine) discoveries and unchallenged fallacies. In several fields of investigation, including many areas of psychological science, perpetuated and unchallenged fallacies may comprise the majority of the circulating evidence. I catalogue a number of impediments to self-correction that have been empirically studied in psychological science. Finally, I discuss some proposed solutions to promote sound replication practices enhancing the credibility of scientific results as well as some potential disadvantages of each of them.Any deviation from the principle that seeking the truth has priority over any other goals may be seriously damaging to the self-correcting functions of science.},

The field responded with suggestions of how fraud could be prevented. However, the Stapel fraud is only one among many cases. Before basing recommendations on one case, it would be informative to study other cases to assess how these frauds were discovered. The authors analyze a convenience sample of fraud cases to see whether (social) psychology is more susceptible to fraud than other disciplines. They also evaluate whether the peer review process and replications work well in practice to detect fraud. There is no evidence that psychology is more vulnerable to fraud than the biomedical sciences, and most frauds are detected through information from whistleblowers with inside information. On the basis of this analysis, the authors suggest a number of strategies that might reduce the risk of scientific fraud.},

	abstract = {Background: Breaches of publication ethics such as plagiarism, data fabrication and redundant publication are recognised as forms of research misconduct that can undermine the scientific literature. We surveyed journal editors to determine their views about a range of publication ethics issues.
Methods: Questionnaire sent to 524 editors-in-chief of Wiley-Blackwell science journals asking about the severity and frequency of 16 ethical issues at their journals, their confidence in handling such issues, and their awareness and use of guidelines.
Results: Responses were obtained from 231 editors (44\%), of whom 48\% edited healthcare journals. The general level of concern about the 16 issues was low, with mean severity scores of ,1 (on a scale of 0–3) for all but one. The issue of greatest concern (mean score 1.19) was redundant publication. Most editors felt confident in handling the issues, with ,15\% feeling ‘‘not at all confident’’ for all but one of the issues (gift authorship, 22\% not confident). Most editors believed such problems occurred less than once a year and .20\% of the editors stated that 12 of the 16 items never occurred at their journal. However, 13\%–47\% did not know the frequency of the problems. Awareness and use of guidelines was generally low. Most editors were unaware of all except other journals’ instructions.
Conclusions: Most editors of science journals seem not very concerned about publication ethics and believe that misconduct occurs only rarely in their journals. Many editors are unfamiliar with available guidelines but would welcome more guidance or training.},

	abstract = {Objective. Prescribing of broad spectrum antibiotics and antidepressants in general practice often does not accord with guidelines. The aim was to determine the effectiveness of educational outreach in improving the prescribing of selected antibiotics and antidepressants, and whether the effect is sustained for two years. Design. Single blind randomized trial. Setting. Twenty-eight general practices in Leicestershire, England. Intervention. Educational outreach visits were undertaken, tailored to barriers to change, 14 practices receiving visits for reducing selected antibiotics and 14 for improving antidepressant prescribing. Main outcome measures. Number of items prescribed per 1000 registered patients for amoxicillin with clavulanic acid (co-amoxiclav) and quinolone antibiotics, and average daily quantities per 1000 patients for lofepramine and ﬂuoxetine antidepressants, measured at the practice level for six-month periods over two years. Results.There was no effect on the prescribing of co-amoxiclav, quinolones, or ﬂuoxetine, but prescribing of lofepramine increased in accordance with the guidelines. The increase persisted throughout two years of follow-up. Conclusion. A simple, group-level educational outreach intervention, designed to take account of identiﬁed barriers to change, can have a modest but sustained effect on prescribing levels. However, outreach is not always effective. The context in which change in prescribing practice is being sought, the views of prescribers concerning the value of the drug, or other unrecognised barriers to change may inﬂuence the effectiveness of outreach.},

	abstract = {Background. A multiple intervention targeted to reduce antibiotic prescribing with an educational outreach programme had proven to be effective in a randomized controlled trial in 12 peer review groups, demonstrating 12\% less prescriptions for respiratory tract infections.
Objective. To assess the effectiveness of a multiple intervention in primary care at a large scale.
Methods. A controlled before and after study in 2006 and 2007 was designed. Participants were from general practices within a geographically deﬁned area in the middle region of The Netherlands. Participants were GPs in 141 practices in 25 peer review groups. A control group of GP practices from the same region, matched for type of practice and mean volume of antibiotic prescribing. The multiple intervention consisted of the following elements: (i) group education meeting and communication training; (ii) monitoring and feedback on prescribing behaviour; (iii) group education for GPs and pharmacists assistants and (iv) patient education material. The main outcome measures are as follows: (i) number of antibiotic prescriptions per 1000 patients per GP and (ii) number of second-choice antibiotics, obtained from claims data from the regional health insurance company. The associations between predictors and outcome measurements were assessed by means of a multiple regression analyses.
Results. At baseline, the number of antibiotic prescriptions per 1000 patients was slightly higher in the intervention group than in the control group (184 versus 176). In 2007, the number of prescriptions had increased to 232 and 227, respectively, and not differed between intervention and control group.
Conclusions. The implementation of an already proven effective multiple intervention strategy at a larger scale showed no reduction of antibiotic prescription rates. The failure might be attributed to a less tight monitoring of intervention and audit. Inserting practical tools in the intervention might be more successful and should be studied.},

	abstract = {Background. Antimicrobial use in acute care is widely reported to be suboptimal. Inappropriate use of antimicrobials is a major contributing factor to the emergence of multidrug resistance and health care–associated infection. Addressing prescribing behavior is a key component of antimicrobial stewardship.
Methods. We performed a novel systematic review of both qualitative and quantitative literature on antimicrobial prescribing behavior in acute care. We assessed the extent to which behavioral sciences and social marketing were used and whether this could be related to the effectiveness of reported outcomes. MEDLINE, Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE), Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts (ASSIA), Business Source Complete, The Cochrane Library, PsychInfo, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE) and Health Management Information Consortium (HMIC) were searched for studies undertaken during the period January 1999–April 2011 and published in English.
Results. Five qualitative and 5 quantitative studies met the quality criteria. Qualitative studies highlight the predominant inﬂuence of social norms, attitudes, and beliefs on antimicrobial prescribing behavior. Quantitative studies reporting interventions to optimize antimicrobial prescribing behavior do not use theoretical science or primary research to inform the design and choice of the interventions deployed.
Conclusions. Despite qualitative evidence demonstrating the impact of behavioral determinants and social norms on prescribing, these inﬂuences are not given due consideration in the design and evaluation of interventions. To ensure a better understanding of prescribing behaviors and to improve the quality of interventions and research in this area, the incorporation and application of behavioral sciences supported by appropriate multidisciplinary collaboration is recommended.},

The paper begins by assessing contemporary definitions and estimates of scientific misconduct. It emphasizes disagreements over such definitions and estimates as a way to tease out tension and controversy over competing visions of scientific research. It concludes by noting that each narrative suggests a different approach for resolving misconduct, and that the difference inherent in these views may help explain much of the discord concerning unethical behavior in the scientific community.},

Traditionally, the field has relied on quantitative methodologists to educate researchers in proper analysis and reporting practices, and to examine these via peer review. The field has also relied on psychologists with training or board service in ethics to establish standards and implement strategies to discourage misconduct. However, this division of responsibility for examination, standard setting, and deterrence is shown to compromise the effectiveness of methodologists’and ethicists’respective gatekeeping efforts. Methodologically and ethically trained specialists instead need to coordinate efforts to safeguard analysis and reporting procedures. Researchers also need to increase self-monitoring. Potential obstacles to achieving these ends are considered, and three tactics are proposed to overcome them.},

In many cases, a researcher is more likely to falsely find evidence that an effect exists than to correctly find evidence that it does not. We present computer simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis. Second, we suggest a simple, low-cost, and straightforwardly effective disclosure-based solution to this problem.

This research demonstrates that cheating is prevalent and that some forms of cheating have increased dramatically in the last 30 years. This research also suggests that although both individual and contextual factors influence cheating, contextual factors, such as students’ perceptions of peers’ behavior, are the most powerful influence. In addition, an institution’s academic integrity programs and policies, such as honor codes, can have a significant influence on students’ behavior. Finally, we offer suggestions for managing cheating from students’ and faculty members’ perspectives.},

	abstract = {In response to calls for more research on how to prevent or detect fraud (ACAP, 2008; AICPA, 2002; Carcello et al., 2008; Wells, 2004), we develop a framework that identifies three psychological pathways to fraud, supported by multiple theories relating to moral intuition and disengagement, rationalization, and the role played by negative affect. The purpose of developing the framework is twofold: 1) to draw attention to important yet under-researched aspects of ethical decision-making, and 2) to increase our understanding of the psychology of committing fraud. Our framework builds on the existing fraud triangle (PCAOB, 2005) which is used by auditors to assess fraud risk. The fraud triangle is composed of three factors that, together, predict the likelihood of fraud within an organization: opportunity, incentive / pressure, and attitude / rationalization. We find that, when faced with the opportunity and incentive / pressure, there are three psychological pathways to fraud nestled within attitude / rationalization: 1) lack of awareness, 2) intuition coupled with rationalization, and 3) reasoning. These distinctions are important for fraud prevention because each of these paths is driven by a different psychological mechanism. This framework is useful in a number of ways. First, it identifies certain insidious situational factors in which individuals commit fraud without recognizing it. Second, it extends our knowledge of rationalization by theorizing that individuals use rationalization to avoid or reduce the negative affect that accompanies performing an unethical behavior. Negative affect is important because individuals wish to avoid it. Third, it identifies several other methods fraudsters use to reduce negative affect, each of which could serve as potential “psychological red flags” and helps predict future fraudulent behavior. Finally, our framework can be used as a theoretical foundation to explore several interventions designed to prevent fraud.},

	abstract = {Background: Excessive use of antibiotics accelerates the acquisition/spread of antimicrobial resistance. A systematic review was conducted to identify the components of successful communication interventions targeted at the general public to improve antibiotic use.
Methods: The databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science and Cochrane Library were searched. Search terms were related to the population (public, community), intervention (campaign, mass media) and outcomes (antibiotic, antimicrobial resistance). References were screened for inclusion by one author with a random subset of 10\% screened by a second author. No date restrictions were applied and only articles in the English language were considered. Studies had to have a control group or be an interrupted time-series. Outcomes had to measure change in antibiotic-related prescribing/consumption and/or the public’s knowledge, attitudes or behaviour. Two reviewers assessed the quality of studies. Narrative synthesis was performed.
Results: Fourteen studies were included with an estimated 74–75 million participants. Most studies were conducted in the United States or Europe and targeted both the general public and clinicians. Twelve of the studies measured changes in antibiotic prescribing. There was quite strong (P , 0Á05 to ! 0Á01) to very strong (P , 0Á001) evidence that interventions that targeted prescribing for RTIs were associated with decreases in antibiotic prescribing; the majority of these studies reported reductions of greater than \#14\% with the largest effect size reaching \#30\%.
Conclusion: Multi-faceted communication interventions that target both the general public and clinicians can reduce antibiotic prescribing in high-income countries but the sustainability of reductions in antibiotic prescribing is unclear.},

These websites are structured around projects: ﬁnite campaigns with welldeﬁned goals, end dates, and completion criteria. We use a dataset from an existing crowdfunding website —the school charity Donors Choose — to understand the value of completing projects. We ﬁnd that completing a project is an important act that leads to larger donations (over twice as large), greater likelihood of returning to donate again, and few projects that expire close but not complete. A conservative estimate suggests that this completion bias led to over \$15 million in increased donations to Donors Choose, representing approximately 16\% of the total donations for the period under study. This bias suggests that structuring many types of collaborative work as a series of projects might increase contribution signiﬁcantly.},

I find large effects on adoptees' education, income and health from assignment to parents with more education and assignment to smaller families. Parental education and family size are significantly more correlated with adoptee outcomes than are parental income or neighborhood characteristics. Outcomes such as drinking, smoking, and the selectivity of college attended are more determined by nurture than is educational attainment. Using the standard behavioral genetics variance decomposition, I find that shared family environment explains fourteen percent of the variation in educational attainment, thirty five percent of the variation in college selectivity, and thirty three percent of the variation in drinking behavior.},

In the U.K. some credit card companies have recently introduced photo-credit cards and the government is currently considering the introduction of a new driving licence including the bearer's photograph. However, the widely held belief that the inclusion of photographs will reduce or prevent fraudulent use has never been tested. This paper describes a field study designed to examine the utility of photo-credit cards by assessing the accuracy with which supermarket cashiers could identify whether the photographs on credit cards depicted the person tendering them. The results demonstrate that the task of matching the photograph to the shopper is much more difficult than might be expected, and that even under optimized conditions, performance is poor. It is concluded that the introduction of photographs on credit cards would have little effect on the detection of fraud at the point of sale. \& 1997 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Objective—To determine if parenthood predicts host resistance to the common cold among healthy volunteers experimentally exposed to a common cold virus.
Methods—Subjects were 795 healthy participants (age range 18–55) enrolled in one of 3 viralchallenge studies conducted from 1993–2004. After reporting parenthood status, participants were quarantined, administered nasal drops containing one of four common cold viruses, and monitored for the development of a clinical cold (infection in the presence of objective signs of illness) on the day before and for 5–6 days after exposure. All analyses included controls for immunity to the experimental virus (pre-challenge specific antibody titers), viral strain, season, age, sex, race/ ethnicity, marital status, body mass, study, employment status and education.
Results—Parents were less likely to develop colds than non-parents (OR=0.48; 95\% CI, 0.31–0.73). This was true for both parents with 1–2 children (OR=0.52; 95\% CI, 0.33–0.83) and 3 or more children (OR=0.39; 95\% CI, 0.22–0.70). Parenthood was associated with a decreased risk of colds for both those with at least one child living at home (OR=0.46; 95\% CI, 0.24–0.87), and those whose children all lived away from home (OR=0.27; 95\% CI, 0.12–0.60). The relationship between parenthood and colds was not observed in parents ages 18–24, but was pronounced among older parents.
Conclusion—Parenthood was associated with greater host resistance to common cold viruses.},

	abstract = {When data are collected via anonymous Internet surveys, particularly under conditions of obligatory participation (such as with student samples), data quality can be a concern. However, little guidance exists in the published literature regarding techniques for detecting careless responses. Previously several potential approaches have been suggested for identifying careless respondents via indices computed from the data, yet almost no prior work has examined the relationships among these indicators or the types of data patterns identified by each. In 2 studies, we examined several methods for identifying careless responses, including (a) special items designed to detect careless response, (b) response consistency indices formed from responses to typical survey items, (c) multivariate outlier analysis, (d) response time, and (e) self-reported diligence. Results indicated that there are two distinct patterns of careless response (random and nonrandom) and that different indices are needed to identify these different response patterns. We also found that approximately 10\%–12\% of undergraduates completing a lengthy survey for course credit were identified as careless responders. In Study 2, we simulated data with known random response patterns to determine the efficacy of several indicators of careless response. We found that the nature of the data strongly influenced the efficacy of the indices to identify careless responses. Recommendations include using identified rather than anonymous responses, incorporating instructed response items before data collection, as well as computing consistency indices and multivariate outlier analysis to ensure high-quality data.},

	abstract = {Methods: Ten academic EDs enrolled adults and children presenting with symptoms consistent with upper respiratory infection. Enrolled patients were interviewed before their physician encounter and were reinterviewed before discharge and 2 weeks later. Physicians were interviewed about factors that inﬂuenced their management decisions, including their perceptions of patients’ expectations. Patients with a single diagnosis of uncomplicated acute bronchitis or upper respiratory infection were included for analysis.
Results: Of 272 patients enrolled, 68\% of bronchitis patients and 9\% of upper respiratory infection patients received antibiotics. Physicians were more likely to prescribe antibiotics when they believed that patients expected them (odds ratio [OR] 5.3; 95\% conﬁdence interval [CI] 2.9 to 9.6), although they were able to correctly identify only 27\% of the patients who expected antibiotics. Satisfaction with the ED visit was reported by 87\% of patients who received antibiotics and 89\% of those not receiving antibiotics. Satisfaction with the visit was reported by 92\% of patients who believed they had a better understanding of their illness but only by 72\% of those who thought they had no better understanding (OR 4.4; 95\% CI 2.0 to 8.4).
Conclusion: Physicians in our academic EDs prescribed antibiotics to 68\% of acute bronchitis patients and to fewer than 10\% of upper respiratory infection patients. Physicians were more likely to prescribe antibiotics to patients who they believed expected them, although they correctly identiﬁed only about 1 in 4 of those patients.

	abstract = {Objectives: Surveys in various countries suggest 17\% to 80\% of doctors prescribe ‘placebos’ in routine practice, but prevalence of placebo use in UK primary care is unknown.
Methods: We administered a web-based questionnaire to a representative sample of UK general practitioners. Following surveys conducted in other countries we divided placebos into ‘pure’ and ‘impure’. ‘Impure’ placebos are interventions with clear efficacy for certain conditions but are prescribed for ailments where their efficacy is unknown, such as antibiotics for suspected viral infections. ‘Pure’ placebos are interventions such as sugar pills or saline injections without direct pharmacologically active ingredients for the condition being treated. We initiated the survey in April 2012. Two reminders were sent and electronic data collection closed after 4 weeks.
Results: We surveyed 1715 general practitioners and 783 (46\%) completed our questionnaire. Our respondents were similar to those of all registered UK doctors suggesting our results are generalizable. 12\% (95\% CI 10 to 15) of respondents used pure placebos while 97\% (95\% CI 96 to 98) used impure placebos at least once in their career. 1\% of respondents used pure placebos, and 77\% (95\% CI 74 to 79) used impure placebos at least once per week. Most (66\% for pure, 84\% for impure) respondents stated placebos were ethical in some circumstances.
Conclusion and implications: Placebo use is common in primary care but questions remain about their benefits, harms, costs, and whether they can be delivered ethically. Further research is required to investigate ethically acceptable and costeffective placebo interventions.},

	abstract = {Methods. This study was an observational, prospective cohort study to determine attack rates for respiratory illnesses within families that have at least 1 child who is 6 months to 5 years of age and enrolled in out-of-home child care. Families were randomly selected from 5 pediatric practices in Massachusetts and were considered eligible when the child was enrolled in child care with at least 5 other children for {\textgreater}10 hours per week. Enrolled families were asked to complete a survey that assessed knowledge about colds, antibiotic indications, and frequency of health service utilization. Predictors of selfreported use of health care services were assessed in multivariate logistic regression models.
Results. Of the 261 families enrolled in the study, 197 families (75\%) returned completed surveys. Although 93\% of parents understood that viruses caused colds, 66\% of parents also believed that colds were caused by bacteria. Fifty-three percent believed that antibiotics were needed to treat colds. Parents reported that they would visit the ED (23\%) or their doctor’s office (60\%) when their child had a cold. Predictors of ED use on multivariate analysis included Medicaid insurance (odds ratio [OR]: 17.6 [2.2–139.3]), history of wheezing (OR: 18.3 [4.4 –75.8]), and belief that antibiotics treat colds (OR: 4.2 [1.4 –12.9]). Predictors of ambulatory care use included parent younger than 30 years (OR: 10.0 [1.6 – 64.3]), history of wheezing (OR: 5.6 [1.1–29.7]), and belief that antibiotics treat colds (OR: 3.8 [1.7– 8.5]).
Conclusions. Misconceptions about the appropriate treatment of colds are predictive of increased health service utilization. Targeted educational interventions for families may reduce inappropriate antibiotic-seeking behavior and unnecessary health service utilization for colds.

Overall, 55\% of all analyzed results were found to provide BF {\textgreater} 10 (often labeled as strong evidence) for the alternative hypothesis, while more than half of the remaining results do not pass the level of BF = 3 (labeled as anecdotal evidence). The results estimate that at least 82\% of all published psychological articles contain one or more significant results that do not provide BF {\textgreater} 10 for the hypothesis. We conclude that due to the threshold of acceptance having been set too low for psychological findings, a substantial proportion of the published results have weak evidential support.},

	abstract = {The current discussion of questionable research practices (QRPs) is meant to improve the quality of science. It is, however, important to conduct QRP studies with the same scrutiny as all research. We note problems with overestimates of QRP prevalence and the survey methods used in the frequently cited study by John, Loewenstein, and Prelec. In a survey of German psychologists, we decomposed QRP prevalence into its two multiplicative components, proportion of scientists who ever committed a behavior and, if so, how frequently they repeated this behavior across all their research. The resulting prevalence estimates are lower by order of magnitudes. We conclude that inflated prevalence estimates, due to problematic interpretation of survey data, can create a descriptive norm (QRP is normal) that can counteract the injunctive norm to minimize QRPs and unwantedly damage the image of behavioral sciences, which are essential to dealing with many societal problems.},

Because only true effects are expected to generate right-skewed /7-curves—containing more low (.01s) than high (.04s) significant p values—only right-skewed p-curves are diagnostic of evidential value.

	abstract = {The frequency with which scientists fabricate and falsify data, or commit other forms of scientific misconduct is a matter of controversy. Many surveys have asked scientists directly whether they have committed or know of a colleague who committed research misconduct, but their results appeared difficult to compare and synthesize. This is the first metaanalysis of these surveys. To standardize outcomes, the number of respondents who recalled at least one incident of misconduct was calculated for each question, and the analysis was limited to behaviours that distort scientific knowledge: fabrication, falsification, ‘‘cooking’’ of data, etc… Survey questions on plagiarism and other forms of professional misconduct were excluded. The final sample consisted of 21 surveys that were included in the systematic review, and 18 in the meta-analysis. A pooled weighted average of 1.97\% (N = 7, 95\%CI: 0.86–4.45) of scientists admitted to have fabricated, falsified or modified data or results at least once –a serious form of misconduct by any standard– and up to 33.7\% admitted other questionable research practices. In surveys asking about the behaviour of colleagues, admission rates were 14.12\% (N = 12, 95\% CI: 9.91–19.72) for falsification, and up to 72\% for other questionable research practices. Meta-regression showed that self reports surveys, surveys using the words ‘‘falsification’’ or ‘‘fabrication’’, and mailed surveys yielded lower percentages of misconduct. When these factors were controlled for, misconduct was reported more frequently by medical/ pharmacological researchers than others. Considering that these surveys ask sensitive questions and have other limitations, it appears likely that this is a conservative estimate of the true prevalence of scientific misconduct.},

Antimicrobial use is a major driver of resistance, and antimicrobial stewardship programmes are increasingly being advocated as a means of improving the quality of prescribing. However, to increase their impact and assess their success, a better understanding of antimicrobial usage, both in primary and secondary care, and linkage with antimicrobial resistance data are required. In England, national summaries of primary care dispensing data are issued annually by the Health and Social Care Information Centre. However, there is currently no routine public reporting of antimicrobial usage in hospitals. In response to the threat posed by antimicrobial resistance, as highlighted in the Report of the Chief Medical Ofﬁcer and on the request of the Department of Health, Public Health England has developed a new national programme, the English Surveillance Programme for Antimicrobial Utilization and Resistance (ESPAUR). The programme will bring together the elements of antimicrobial utilization and resistance surveillance in both primary and secondary care settings, alongside the development of quality measures and methods to monitor unintended outcomes of antimicrobial stewardship and both public and professional behaviour interventions. This article reports on the background to the programme development, the current oversight group membership and the public reporting structure.},

	abstract = {Background. Respiratory tract infections (RTI) in children is the most common cause of prescription of antibiotics. It is important to describe and analyse non-medical factors in order to develop more rational use of antibiotics.
Objectives.To compare families with high and low concern about infectious illness with regard to social variables, perception of infection proneness and beliefs in antibiotics and to relate the concern for infectious illness to reported morbidity, physician consultations and antibiotic prescriptions for the 18-month-old child in the family.
Methods. A prospective, population-based survey was performed. During 1 month, all infectious symptoms, physician consultations and antibiotic treatments for 18-month-old children were noted. The 818 families also answered questions about their socio-economic situation, illness perception and concern about infectious illness.
Results. High concern about infectious illness was associated with more frequent physicians consultations and more prescriptions of antibiotics. There was no signiﬁcant difference in reported days with symptoms of RTI, but the parents more often experienced their children with RTI without fever as being ill. The variables of infection proneness in the child, inadequate beliefs in antibiotics and the factor of being the only child were important explanatory factors for concern about infectious illness.
Conclusions. High concern about infectious illness is an important determining factor for physician consultations and antibiotic prescription for small children. An adequate consultation, where the doctor deals with the parents’ worries and gives appropriate information about symptoms and disease, might contribute to less antibiotic prescribing with preserved parental satisfaction.},

DATA SOURCES: A computerized search of Ovid MEDLINE was conducted for research articles published between 1966 and September 2004 using a key word search of MeSH subject headings and titles. Search terms included managed care or health maintenance organization and antibacterial agents or antibiotic or antimicrobial. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Studies evaluating initiatives in ambulatory managed-care environments and the effects of managed care on treatment of RTIs were chosen. Articles addressing both population and individual level tools were included. DATA SYNTHESIS: Initiatives have been attempted in a variety of managed-care models. In some studies, multidimensional educational interventions were effective in decreasing antimicrobial prescribing rates for RTIs. However, in other studies, no decrease in antimicrobial prescribing after implementation of an evidence-based guideline or initiation of an educational intervention was observed. In one successful study, patient satisfaction was similar between groups. Each study had limitations in design or generalizability. Several studies had strengths, including using randomized groups or offering multidimensional educational efforts. CONCLUSIONS: Randomized prospective studies of interventions to improve antimicrobial prescribing for RTIs in managed care have been variably successful. Because the topic is one of ongoing importance, it will continue to be an area of research.},

	abstract = {Several studies have reported that parents are often reluctant to vaccinate their own or other peopleÕs children, even when the balance of health risks and beneﬁts clearly favors vaccination. This reluctance has been interpreted as a manifestation of ‘‘omission bias’’, a general tendency to prefer inactive to active options even when inaction leads to worse outcomes or greater risks. The research raises signiﬁcant public health concerns as well as worries about human decision biases in general. In this paper we argue that existing research on vaccination decisions has not convincingly demonstrated any general reluctance to vaccinate nor has it made the case that such a tendency, if found, would constitute a bias. We identify several conceptual and methodological issues that, we argue, cloud interpretation of earlier studies. In a new questionnaire-based study (Experiment 1) we examined the vaccination decisions of undergraduate students (N ¼ 103) and non-student adults (N ¼ 192). In both groups a clear majority chose to vaccinate when disease and vaccination risks were balanced. Experiments 2 and 3 identify several problems associated with the measures used in earlier studies, and show how these problems could have led to the misleading appearance of majority anti-vaccination preferences. In our data, vaccination intentions appear to be less a function of generalized preferences for action or inaction than they are of the regret respondents expect to feel if vaccination or non-vaccination were to lead to a poor outcome. Regret-avoiding choices led some respondents to favor vaccination, others to oppose it. In two follow-up studies, few respondents mentioned action or inaction per se in explaining their choices. We conclude that there is no convincing evidence that a generalized ‘‘omission bias’’ plays any important role in vaccination decisions.},

	doi = {10.1378/chest.128.3.1497},
	abstract = {Background: Pulmonary and critical care physicians routinely make complex decisions, but little is known about cognitive aspects of this process. Omission bias and status quo bias are well-descibed cognitive biases that can cause lay decision makers to prefer inaction that preserves the status quo even when changing the status quo through action is more likely to lead to the best outcomes. It is unknown if these biases influence trained decision makers such as pulmonologists. Study objectives: To determine whether omission bias and status quo bias influence the medical decisions of pulmonologists. Design and interventions: The study was a randomized controlled trial conducted within a cross-sectional survey of pulmonologists’ opinions about the relevance of various factors in pulmonary and critical care decision making. We designed case vignettes that presented patient information with an associated patient management choice. The status quo state and the action/omission distinction were varied in two forms of otherwise identical vignettes. One form of each case vignette pair (A and B) was administered randomly to each prospective respondent during the first mailing of the opinion survey. Participants: Five hundred pulmonologists selected randomly from the membership of the American College of Chest Physicians.
Measurements and results: There were 125 respondents, including 59 for form A and 66 form B (enrollment rate, 25\%). In vignettes involving evaluation of pulmonary embolism and treatment of septic shock, respondents were more likely to choose a suboptimal management strategy when an omission option was present that allowed preservation of the status quo (71\% vs 53\%, p ؍ 0.048; 50\% vs 29\%, p ؍ 0.016, respectively). In a vignette involving a hypothetical clinical trial and the decision to prescribe tube feeding, the omission option was not significantly associated with the decision to prescribe tube feeding (54\% vs 50\%, p ؍ 0.67).
Conclusion: Pulmonary and critical care decisions are susceptible to the influence of omission and status quo bias. Because of the great number of decisions that are made each day involving choices between maintaining or changing the status quo, this finding could have far-reaching implications for patient outcomes, cost-effectiveness, resource utilization, clinical practice variability, and medical errors.},

Recent articles (Connolly \& Reb, 2003; Patt \& Zeckhauser, 2000; Tanner \& Medin, in press) have raised questions about the generality of this phenomenon and have suggested that the opposite bias (action bias) sometimes exists. Prentice and Koehler (2003) have suggested that omission bias is sometimes confounded with a bias toward what is normal, a bias they ﬁnd. We review this literature and report new data showing omission bias with appropriate methods, as well as a small normality bias that cannot explain the omission bias. The data suggest that the bias is largely based on the distinction between direct and indirect causation, rather than that between action and inaction as such. We report substantial individual diﬀerences: some subjects show action bias. We argue, though, that concern about omission bias is justiﬁed if only a substantial minority of people show it.},

Design / A cross-sectional multi-centre epidemiological survey. Á Setting / Thirty primary care health centres in Finland. ÁÁ Subjects / 7284 patients with symptoms of possible acute rhinosinuÁ sitis during one week in both November 1998 and November 1999. Main outcome measure / Symptoms and their duration, use of Á diagnostic tools, choice of antibiotics, patient outcomes. Results / A total of 1601 patients were diagnosed as having AMS (12\% of all patients with infectious disease). In 45\% of cases the differentiation between AMS and URTI was based on clinical examination alone. Sinus ultrasound was the most common diagnostic tool used (38\%). Sinus radiography or blood tests (CRP or leukocytes) were both studied in 8\% of cases. AMS was diagnosed and treated with antibiotics also in the early stages of URTI when viruses are the most likely explanation. In total, 83\% of patients with AMS received a prescription for antibiotics; the most common choice was amoxycillin Á (37\%), doxycycline was used in 29\% of cases, and macrolides in 15\%. Conclusions / Antibiotics are prescribed for AMS 2 to 5 times more often than true disease incidence would suggest in Finland. The choice of antibiotics follows the guideline recommendations; however, use of macrolides is higher than recommended. Physicians feel strong pressure from patients to prescribe antibiotics for AMS. Primary care physicians need better support in the accurate diagnosis of AMS.},

	abstract = {In soccer penalty kicks, goalkeepers choose their action before they can clearly observe the kick direction. An analysis of 286 penalty kicks in top leagues and championships worldwide shows that given the probability distribution of kick direction, the optimal strategy for goalkeepers is to stay in the goal’s center. Goalkeepers, however, almost always jump right or left. We propose the following explanation for this behavior: because the norm is to jump, norm theory (Kahneman, D., \& Miller, D. T. (1986). Norm theory: Comparing reality to its alternatives. Psychological Review, 93, 136–153) implies that a goal scored yields worse feelings for the goalkeeper following inaction (staying in the center) than following action (jumping), leading to a bias for action. The omission bias, a bias in favor of inaction, is reversed here because the norm here is reversed – to act rather than to choose inaction. The claim that jumping is the norm is supported by a second study, a survey conducted with 32 top professional goalkeepers. The seemingly biased decision making is particularly striking since the goalkeepers have huge incentives to make correct decisions, and it is a decision they encounter frequently. Finally, we discuss several implications of the action/omission bias for economics and management.},

This effect is even greater when there is a ‘risk group’ for death (with its overall probability held constant), even though the test for membership in the risk group is unavailable. This effect cannot be explained in terms of a tendency to assume that the child is in the risk group. A risk group for death from the disease has no effect on reluctance to vaccinate. The reluctance is an example of omission bias (Spranca, Minsk \&Baron, in press), an overgeneralization of a distinction between commissions and omissions to a case in which it is irrelevant. Likewise, it would ordinarily be prudent to find out whether a child is in a risk group before acting, but in this case it is impossible, so knowledge of the existence of the risk group is irrelevant. The risk-group effect is consistent with Frisch \& Baron’s (1988) interpretation of ambiguity.},

Subjects either judged the morality of actors by their choices or rated the goodness of decision options. Subjects often rated harmful omissions as less immoral, or less bad as decisions, than harmful commissions. Such ratings were associated with judgments that omissions do not cause outcomes. The eﬀect of commission is not simply an exaggerated response to commissions: a reverse eﬀect for good outcomes was not found, and a few subjects were even willing to accept greater harm in order to avoid action. The ‘omission bias’ revealed in these experiments can be described as an overgeneralization of a useful heuristic to cases in which it is not justiﬁed. Additional experiments indicated that that subjects’ judgments about the immorality of omissions and commissions are dependent on several factors that ordinarily distinguish omissions and commissions: physical movement in commissions, the presence of salient alternative causes in omissions, and the fact that the consequences of omissions would occur if the actor were absent or ignorant of the eﬀects of not acting.},

	abstract = {Misuse of antibiotic therapy can have a profound negative impact both on individuals and on the community. The objective of this metaanalysis was to estimate the prevalence of antibiotic misuse in terms of non-compliance with therapy or reuse of leftover antibiotics in the community. Of 2848 screened articles, 46 contained the required information on the number of participants, the number compliant/using leftovers and the measurement technique. Mean compliance with antibiotics was 62.2\% (95\% conﬁdence interval (CI), 56.4–68.0\%) and mean use of leftover antibiotics was 28.6\% (95\% CI, 21.8–35.4\%). Although variation in the methods resulted in substantial heterogeneity in the estimates, results were generally consistent by region and measurement technique. Patient education and simpler antibiotic regimens should be encouraged to promote responsible use of antibiotic therapy.},

	abstract = {A global patient survey of non-compliance with antibiotic therapy for acute community infections included 4514 adult respondents (aged 18–99 years) in 11 countries. Admitted non-compliance (ANC) was reported in 912/4088 (22.3\%) of cases but varied widely between countries. Multivariate analysis identiﬁed ﬁve independent variables associated with ANC: country, daily dosage regimen, age, attitudes to doctors and attitudes to antibiotics. ANC ranged from 44.0\% in China to 9.9\% in The Netherlands, and from 14.9\% in those prescribed once-daily regimens to 27.0\% for three or more daily doses. There was a negative correlation between ANC and age. Analysis of the attitudes to doctors conﬁrmed previous ﬁndings that involving the patient in the management of their infection can improve overall compliance. The study identiﬁed seven key attitudes to antibiotic use with the potential to improve compliance. However, there was a poor understanding in 10 of the 11 countries of how non-compliance can increase the potential for resistance development. Segmentation and cluster analysis identiﬁed four psychographic proﬁles inﬂuencing compliant behaviour, which varied across countries. The global picture of antibiotic non-compliance and psychographic proﬁling should help identify areas for targeted, country-speciﬁc patient educational programmes as well as those areas where physicians can improve their interaction with their patients.},

This assumption was tested on two controversial domains, which were relatively novel for the chosen population: nanoscience and HPV vaccination. Participants (N = 339) evaluated respective risks and benefits, either without or after reading balanced arguments. Contrary to earlier findings, positive perception of nanoscience was associated with egalitarianism. Worldviews of the pro- and conadvocate of nanoscience influenced risk perception among people with little prior knowledge. Assessment of risks inherent to HPV vaccination was positively associated with hierarchism among men, negatively with familiarity among women, and sensitive to the worldviews of the advocates. We provide a discussion on how evaluation of risks and benefits in novel domains is affected by a complex interplay of cultural cognition, domain familiarity, personal relevance and general risk attitudes.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE To assess effects of behavioral interventions and rates of inappropriate (not guideline-concordant) antibiotic prescribing during ambulatory visits for acute respiratory tract infections. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Cluster randomized clinical trial conducted among 47 primary care practices in Boston and Los Angeles. Participants were 248 enrolled clinicians randomized to receive 0, 1, 2, or 3 interventions for 18 months. All clinicians received education on antibiotic prescribing guidelines on enrollment. Interventions began between November 1, 2011, and October 1, 2012. Follow-up for the latest-starting sites ended on April 1, 2014. Adult patients with comorbidities and concomitant infections were excluded. INTERVENTIONS Three behavioral interventions, implemented alone or in combination: suggested alternatives presented electronic order sets suggesting nonantibiotic treatments; accountable justification prompted clinicians to enter free-text justifications for prescribing antibiotics into patients’ electronic health records; peer comparison sent emails to clinicians that compared their antibiotic prescribing rates with those of “top performers” (those with the lowest inappropriate prescribing rates). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Antibiotic prescribing rates for visits with antibiotic-inappropriate diagnoses (nonspecific upper respiratory tract infections, acute bronchitis, and influenza) from 18 months preintervention to 18 months afterward, adjusting each intervention’s effects for co-occurring interventions and preintervention trends, with random effects for practices and clinicians.
RESULTS There were 14 753 visits (mean patient age, 47 years; 69\% women) for antibiotic-inappropriate acute respiratory tract infections during the baseline period and 16 959 visits (mean patient age, 48 years; 67\% women) during the intervention period. Mean antibiotic prescribing rates decreased from 24.1\% at intervention start to 13.1\% at intervention month 18 (absolute difference, −11.0\%) for control practices; from 22.1\% to 6.1\% (absolute difference, −16.0\%) for suggested alternatives (difference in differences, −5.0\% [95\% CI, −7.8\% to 0.1\%]; P = .66 for differences in trajectories); from 23.2\% to 5.2\% (absolute difference, −18.1\%) for accountable justification (difference in differences, −7.0\% [95\% CI, −9.1\% to −2.9\%]; P {\textless} .001); and from 19.9\% to 3.7\% (absolute difference, −16.3\%) for peer comparison (difference in differences, −5.2\% [95\% CI, −6.9\% to −1.6\%]; P {\textless} .001). There were no statistically significant interactions (neither synergy nor interference) between interventions.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among primary care practices, the use of accountable justification and peer comparison as behavioral interventions resulted in lower rates of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for acute respiratory tract infections.},

Although public knowledge, beliefs, and experiences of antibiotics contribute to these expectations, little is known about these public views. Aim To gain insight into public knowledge, beliefs, and experiences of antibiotics and respiratory tract infections. Design of study Cross-sectional, internet-based questionnaire study. Setting Members of the general public aged 16 years and over in the Netherlands.
Methods Public knowledge, beliefs, and experiences of antibiotics and respiratory tract infections, as well as predictors of accurate knowledge of antibiotic effectiveness, were measured using 20 questions with sub-items. The questionnaire was given to a Dutch community-based nationwide internet panel of 15 673 individuals. Of these, 1248 eligible responders were invited to participate; 935 responders (75\%) completed the questionnaire.
Results Of the participants, 44.6\% accurately identified antibiotics as being effective against bacteria and not viruses. Acute bronchitis was considered to require treatment with antibiotics by nearly 60\% of responders. The perceived need for antibiotics for respiratory tract infection-related symptoms ranged from 6.5\% for cough with transparent phlegm, to 46.2\% for a cough lasting for more than 2 weeks.
Conclusion Public misconceptions on the effectiveness of, and indications for, antibiotics exist. Nearly half of all responders (47.8\%) incorrectly identified antibiotics as being effective in treating viral infections. Doctors should be aware that unnecessary prescribing could facilitate misconceptions regarding antibiotics and respiratory tract infections. Expectations of receiving antibiotics were higher for the disease label ‘acute bronchitis’ than for any of the separate or combined symptoms prominently present in respiratory tract infection. Public beliefs and expectations should be taken into account when developing interventions targeting the public, patients, and physicians to reduce unnecessary prescribing of antibiotics for respiratory tract infections.},

	abstract = {Background GPs decide whether or not to prescribe antibiotics for acute cough. Apart from clinical signs and symptoms, non-medical reasons influence this decision as well. Aim To obtain a valid estimate of the effect of perceived patient demand. Design of study Secondary analysis of cluster randomised controlled trial data. Setting Eighty-five Flemish GPs.
Method GPs completed a preprinted form with medical as well as non-medical information and their prescription for 20 consecutive adult patients consulting with acute cough in the periods February to April 2000 and 2001. The effect of perceived patient demand on antibiotic prescribing was estimated by performing alternating logistic regression analysis. A hierarchical backwards elimination procedure, described by Kleinbaum, was used.
Results Seventy-two GPs participated, including 1448 patients eligible for analysis; 500 (34.5\%) were prescribed an antibiotic and, according to the GP, 218 (15.1\%) asked for an antibiotic. In cases of perceived patient demand antibiotics were prescribed significantly more often (odds ratio [OR] = 4.64, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 2.96 to 7.26). In the final model (n = 819; OR = 4.60, 2.59 to 8.17); Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness-of-fit P = 0.72), the effect of perceived patient demand for an antibiotic depended on the outcome of the lung auscultation. When patient demand was perceived, antibiotics were prescribed significantly more often only in the case of a normal lung auscultation or in the case of only one abnormal auscultatory finding (adjusted OR = 20.83, 95\% CI = 8.86 to 48.99; adjusted OR = 4.79; 95\% CI = 2.16 to 10.60, respectively).
Conclusions Perceived patient demand has a significant, independent and clinically relevant effect on antibiotic prescribing for acute cough with negative findings on the lung auscultation. Practice guidelines and interventions to optimise antibiotic prescribing have to take this effect into account.},

	abstract = {Objectives: To determine the effect of the 2008 English public antibiotic campaigns.
Methods: English and Scottish (acting as controls) adults aged ≥15 years were questioned face to face about their attitudes to and use of antibiotics, in January 2008 (1888) before and in January 2009 (1830) after the antibiotic campaigns.
Results: Among English respondents, there was a small increase in recollection of campaign posters (2009 23.7\% versus 2008 19.2\%; P¼ 0.03), but this increase was only 2.3\% higher in England than in Scotland. We did not detect any improvement in either England or Scotland, or any differences between England and Scotland in the understanding of the lack of beneﬁt of antibiotics for coughs and colds, and we found no improvement in antibiotic use. We detected a signiﬁcant increase in respondents retaining leftover antibiotics. Over 20\% reported discussing antibiotics with their general practitioner (GP) or nurse in the year to January 2009. The offer of a delayed antibiotic prescription was reported signiﬁcantly more often by English respondents (19\% versus 8\% Scottish in 2009; P ¼0.01), and English respondents were advised to use other remedies for coughs and colds signiﬁcantly more often in the year to January 2009 (12.7\% in 2009 versus 7.4\% in 2008; P , 0.001).
Conclusions: There is little evidence that the 2008 public antibiotic campaigns were effective. The use and visibility of future campaign materials needs auditing. A carefully planned approach that targets the public in GP waiting rooms and through clinicians in consultations may be a more effective way of improving prudent antibiotic use.},

From 2000 to 2003, active screening and decontamination of ICU patients, hospital wide alcohol based hand rubs (ABHR) use, control of specific classes of antibiotics, compliance audits, and feed-backs to the care providers were successively implemented. The efficacy of the program was assessed by HA-MRSA colonized and bacteremic patient rates per 1000 patient-days in patients hospitalized for more than twenty-four hours.
Results: Compliance with the isolation practices increased between 2000 and 2009. Consumption of ABHR increased from 6.8 L to 27.5 L per 1000 patient-days. The use of antibiotic Defined Daily Doses (DDD) per 1000 patient-days decreased by 31\%. HA-MRSA colonization decreased by 84\% from 1.09 to 0.17 per 1000 patient-days and HA-MRSA bacteremia by 93\%, from 0.15 to 0.01 per 1000 patient-days (p {\textless} 10−7 for each rate).
Conclusions: In an area highly endemic for MRSA, a multifaceted prevention program allows for sustainable reduction in HA-MRSA bacteremia rates.},

This research demonstrates that a provider’s social behavior moderates the effect of expectations on physiological outcomes. Methods: After inducing an allergic reaction in participants through a histamine skin prick test, a health care provider administered a cream with no active ingredients and set either positive expectations (cream will reduce reaction) or negative expectations (cream will increase reaction). The provider demonstrated either high or low warmth, or either high or low competence. Results: The impact of expectations on allergic response was enhanced when the provider acted both warmer and more competent and negated when the provider acted colder and less competent. Conclusion: This study suggests that placebo effects should be construed not as a nuisance variable with mysterious impact but instead as a psychological phenomenon that can be understood and harnessed to improve treatment outcomes.},

	abstract = {This paper reports a cross-study analysis of four studies, aiming to understand the drivers of parental consulting and clinician prescribing behaviour when children under 12 years consult primary care with acute respiratory tract infections (RTI). Qualitative data were obtained from three primary studies and one systematic review. Purposeful samples were obtained for (i) a focus group study of parents' information needs and help seeking; (ii) an interview study of parents' experiences of primary health care (60 parents in total); and (iii) an interview study of clinicians' experiences of RTI consultations for children (28 clinicians). The systematic review synthesised parent and clinician views of prescribing for children with acute illness. Reoccurring themes and common patterns across the whole data set were noted. Through an iterative approach involving re-examination of the primary data, translation of common themes across all the studies and re-organisation of these themes into conceptual groups, four overarching themes were identiﬁed. These were: the perceived vulnerability of children; seeking safety in the face of uncertainty; seeking safety from social disapproval; and experience and perception of safety. The social construction of children as vulnerable and normative beliefs about the roles of parents and clinicians were reﬂected in parents' and clinicians' beliefs and decision making when a child had an RTI. Consulting and prescribing antibiotics were both perceived as the safer course of action. Therefore perception of a threat or uncertainty about that threat tended to lead to parental consulting and clinician antibiotic prescribing. Clinician and parent experience could inﬂuence the perception of safety in either direction, depending on whether previous action had resulted in perceived increases or decreases in safety. Future interventions aimed at reducing unnecessary consulting or antibiotic prescribing need to consider how to make the desired action ﬁt with social norms and feel safer for parents and clinicians.

	abstract = {Background: Excessive use of antibiotics accelerates the acquisition/spread of antimicrobial resistance. A systematic review was conducted to identify the components of successful communication interventions targeted at the general public to improve antibiotic use.
Methods: The databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science and Cochrane Library were searched. Search terms were related to the population (public, community), intervention (campaign, mass media) and outcomes (antibiotic, antimicrobial resistance). References were screened for inclusion by one author with a random subset of 10\% screened by a second author. No date restrictions were applied and only articles in the English language were considered. Studies had to have a control group or be an interrupted time-series. Outcomes had to measure change in antibiotic-related prescribing/consumption and/or the public’s knowledge, attitudes or behaviour. Two reviewers assessed the quality of studies. Narrative synthesis was performed.
Results: Fourteen studies were included with an estimated 74–75 million participants. Most studies were conducted in the United States or Europe and targeted both the general public and clinicians. Twelve of the studies measured changes in antibiotic prescribing. There was quite strong (P , 0Á05 to ! 0Á01) to very strong (P , 0Á001) evidence that interventions that targeted prescribing for RTIs were associated with decreases in antibiotic prescribing; the majority of these studies reported reductions of greater than \#14\% with the largest effect size reaching \#30\%.
Conclusion: Multi-faceted communication interventions that target both the general public and clinicians can reduce antibiotic prescribing in high-income countries but the sustainability of reductions in antibiotic prescribing is unclear.},

Design Prospective, nonrandomized controlled trial, including baseline (November 1996-February 1997) and study (November 1997-February 1998) periods. Setting Four selected primary care practices belonging to a group-model health maintenance organization in the Denver, Colo, metropolitan area. Participants Consecutive adults diagnosed as having uncomplicated acute bronchitis. A total of 2462 adults were included at baseline and 2027 adults were included in the study. Clinicians included 56 physicians, 28 physician assistants or nurse practitioners, and 9 registered nurses. Intervention The full intervention site received household and office-based patient educational materials, as well as a clinician intervention consisting of education, practiceprofiling, and academic detailing. A limited intervention site received only officebased educational materials, and control sites provided usual care. Main Outcome Measure Antibiotic prescriptions for uncomplicated acute bronchitis during baseline and study periods.
Results Antibiotic prescription rates for uncomplicated acute bronchitis were similar at all 4 sites during the baseline period. During the study period, there was a substantial decline in antibiotic prescription rates at the full intervention site (from 74\% to 48\% [P = .003]), but not at the control and limited intervention sites (78\% to 76\% [P = .81] and 82\% to 77\% [P = .68], respectively). Compared with control sites, changes in nonantibiotic prescriptions (inhaled bronchodilators, cough suppressants, and analgesics) were not significantly different for intervention sites. Return office visits (within 30 days of the incident visit) for bronchitis or pneumonia did not change significantly for any of the sites.
Conclusions Antibiotic treatment of adults diagnosed as having uncomplicated acute bronchitis can be safely reduced using a combination of patient and clinician interventions. JAMA. 1999;281:1512-1519},

	abstract = {Objective: To assess reliability, responsiveness, importance to patients, and convergent validity for the Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey (WURSS-44) and to develop a short-form WURSS. Study Design and Setting: Community-based recruitment of participants with colds. Prospective monitoring from within 48 hours of ﬁrst symptom until 2 days after end of cold. The WURSS-44 includes 1 global illness severity item, 32 symptom-based items, 10 functional quality-of-life items, and 1 item assessing global change. The SF-36, SF-8, and the Jackson cold scale were used as external comparators.
Results: Participants included 104 women and 45 men, aged 18 to 80 years, self-reporting on 1,681 person-days of illness. Factor analysis suggested 10 dimensions, with reliability coefﬁcients from 0.62 to 0.93. Comparing daily WURSS-44 to Jackson and SF-8 yielded Pearson correlation coefﬁcients from 0.73 to 0.93, and from Ϫ0.60 to Ϫ0.84, respectively. Importance to patients and responsiveness assessment yielded a short version, the WURSS-21. Guyatt’s responsiveness index was 0.54 for the SF-8, 0.61 for the Jackson, 0.71 for the WURSS-44, and 0.80 for the WURSS-21, suggesting that a two-armed trial would require 74 participants for the WURSS-21, 92 for the WURSS-44, 124 for the Jackson scale, and 156 for the SF-8.
Conclusions: The construct validity of WURSS-44 is supported by measures of reliability, responsiveness, importance to patients, and convergence. A shorter version, the WURSS-21, may be even more responsive. Ć 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Design: In a prospective randomized study, 65 consecutive patients with their first MI aged were assigned to receive an intervention designed to alter their perceptions about their MI or usual care from rehabilitation nurses. Patients were assessed in hospital before and after the intervention and at 3 months after discharge from hospital. Results: The intervention caused significant positive changes in patients’ views of their MI. Patients in the intervention group also reported they were better prepared for leaving hospital (p Ͻ .05) and subsequently returned to work at a significantly faster rate than the control group (p Ͻ .05). At the 3-month follow-up, patients in the intervention group reported a significantly lower rate of angina symptoms than control subjects (14.3 vs. 39.3, p Ͻ .03). There was no significant differences in rehabilitation attendance between the two groups. Conclusions: An in-hospital intervention designed to change patients’ illness perceptions can result in improved functional outcome after MI.},

	abstract = {Background: A range of neuropathological and psychosocial factors have been implicated in the aetiology and maintenance of post-concussional syndrome (PCS), with a growing consensus in the literature that this is a complex, multifactorial condition. The role of patients’ perceptions in PCS has not been examined to date.
Objective: This longitudinal study examines the role of illness perceptions in predicting outcome following mild head injury, controlling for severity of injury, post-traumatic stress symptoms, anxiety and depression, using a logistic regression analysis.
Method: 73 patients were admitted to an accident and emergency department with mild head injury (Glasgow Coma Scale score 13–15; loss of consciousness ,20 min; posttraumatic amnesia ,24 h). Data on PCS symptomatology, illness perceptions, post-traumatic stress symptoms, anxiety and depression were collected after the injury and at the 3 month follow-up. Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate predictors of outcome.
Results: Following a mild head injury, symptomatic patients who believe that their symptoms have serious negative consequences on their lives and will continue to do so, are at heightened risk of experiencing significant enduring postconcussional symptoms (p,0.001). Adding measures of severity of injury, post-traumatic stress symptoms, anxiety and depression to the regression model did not improve prediction of outcome.
Conclusion: Whatever other physical or psychological factors may be involved, patients’ perceptions of their illness early after head injury play a part in the persistence of PCS.},

Consecutive patients consulting eight general practices were eligible to take part in a prospective cohort study, providing data within 3 weeks of consultation and 6 months later. Illness perceptions were measured using the Revised Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ-R). Clinical outcome was deﬁned using the Roland and Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) and patients’ global rating of change. Associations between patients, perceptions and poor outcome were analysed using unadjusted and adjusted risk ratios (RR) and 95\% conﬁdence intervals. 1591 completed questionnaires were received at baseline and 810 at 6 months. Patients had a mean age of 44 years and 59\% were women. Mean (SD) RMDQ score at baseline was 8.6 (6.0) and 6.2 (6.1) at 6 months. 52\% and 41\% of patients had a poor clinical outcome at 6 months using RMDQ and global rating scores, respectively. There were strong, statistically signiﬁcant, associations (RRs of 1.4 and over) between IPQ-R baseline consequences, timeline acute/chronic, personal control and treatment control scores and poor outcome. Patients who expected their back problem to last a long time, who perceived serious consequences, and who held weak beliefs in the controllability of their back problem were more likely to have poor clinical outcomes 6 months after they consulted their doctor. These results have implications for the management of patients, and support the need to assess and address patients’ cognitions about their back problems.},

Methods—We conducted a randomized controlled trial of 719 patients with new cold onset. Participants were randomized to three groups: no patient-practitioner interaction, “standard” interaction or an “enhanced” interaction. Cold severity was assessed twice daily. Patients randomized to practitioner visits used the Consultation and Relational Empathy (CARE) measure to rate clinician empathy. Interleukin 8 (IL-8) and neutrophil counts were obtained from nasal wash at baseline and 48 hours later.
Results—Patients’ perceptions of the clinical encounter were associated with reduced cold severity and duration. Encounters rated perfect on the CARE score had reduced severity (Perfect: 223, sub-perfect: 271, p=0.04) and duration (Perfect: 5.89 days, sub-perfect: 7.00 days, p=0.003). CARE scores were also associated with a more significant change in IL-8 (Perfect: mean IL-8 change 1586, sub-perfect: 72, p=0.02) and neutrophil count (Perfect: 49, sub-perfect: 12, p=0.09).
Conclusions—When patients perceive clinicians as empathetic, rating them perfect on the CARE tool, the severity, duration and objective measures (IL-8 and neutrophils) of the common cold significantly change.},

	abstract = {Objective - To study how different doctors at a primary health care centre prescribe antibiotics for respiratory tract infections, and, if possible, to identify reasons for - differences in prescribing habits. Design All medical visits to the health centre because of respiratory tract infections during January and February were studied in four consecutive years (19901993). The principles for prescribing antibiotics were discussed continously to obtain more uniform routines. Setting - The health centre of Teleborg serves a suburban district with about 10 000 - inhabitants, and rural surroundings with another 2 000 inhabitants. Subjects All 2150 visits because of respiratory tract infections (except acute otitis media) made during the studied eight months. All physicians employed at the health - centre (five physicians were employed for the whole study period). Main outcome measures Percentage of visits resulting in prescription of antibiotics, and diagnoses given.
Results - Antibiotics were prescribed for 76\% of the patients by the most generous doctor, but only for 21\% by the most restrictive one. The use of diagnoses suggesting bacterial infection varied in a similar way. Otherwise, the patients of the various doctors looked very much the same, and the return visits for the same complaint during the study months were about 5\% for all doctors. In spite of the on-going policy discussions, the doctors kept their positions as generous or restrictive prescribers throughout the study period.
Conclusion - Doctors have an individual and very constant pattern of prescribing antibiotics, and it seems that the diagnoses are often given to justify the treatment, rather than the other way round.},

The goal of this study was to document the frequency of self-reported failure to return for HIV test results (FTR) and associated reasons among persons at high risk for HIV infection.
Methods: Respondents were recruited at gay bars (men who have sex with men [MSM]), by street intercept (injection drug users [IDUs]), or at sexually transmitted disease clinics (high-risk heterosexuals [HRHs]) in 7 US states in 2000. Self-reported history of and reasons for FTR were evaluated.
Results: FTR was commonly reported among 2241 respondents: 10\% of MSM, 20\% of HRHs, and 27\% of IDUs reported FTR at least once. FTR was significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) more common among those with higher perceived risk of HIV infection and significantly less common among HRHs who had completed more than high school (vs. high school or General Education Development certificate) or were employed part time (vs. unemployed). About one fourth of respondents cited fear of getting test results as an important reason for FTR.
Conclusion: Self-reported occurrences of FTR in our venuerecruited sample were similar to proportions of FTR previously reported from publicly funded venues. Increased pretest counseling on fear of learning HIV status and on the availability of rapid testing may help to reduce FTR.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Intervention programs can reduce inappropriate antibiotic use for the treatment of acute bronchitis in a closed health maintenance organization model.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of a pharmacy-based intervention program intended to reduce antibiotic use in the treatment of acute bronchitis in a community-based physician group model. SUBJECTS: Adult and pediatric patients with an office or urgent care visit for acute bronchitis during the baseline and study periods were included in the study. The clinicians were primary care physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants in a suburban community-based physician group setting.
METHODS: All patients treated for acute bronchitis from January 1 through June 30, 1998, were evaluated for initial receipt of antibiotics and use of clinic resources (office visits, additional antibiotics). From September through December of 1998, physicians were provided literature from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), cough and cold package inserts, and newsletters intended to educate the providers regarding the inappropriateness of antibiotics in the treatment of acute bronchitis. Patient-directed literature from the CDC was placed in the examination rooms and clinic waiting areas beginning September 1998. From January 1 through June 30, 1999, all patients treated for acute bronchitis were assessed for receipt of antibiotics and use of clinic resources. A separate geographic clinic site served as a control during both study periods.
RESULTS: During 1998, 888 of 1840 patients (48.3\%) received antibiotics for treatment of acute bronchitis; this total decreased to 924 of 2392 (38.6\%; p ≤ 0.001) in 1999, a reduction of 20\%. The rate of antibiotic prescribing in control patients was unchanged during the concomitant time periods (142/446, 31.8\% vs. 102/321, 31.8\%). The rate of subsequent physician visits was similar (8\% vs. 9\%) between patients receiving antibiotics and those who did not. However, significantly more patients initially receiving antibiotics required a subsequent antibiotic prescription (45/1812, 2.5\% vs. 24/2420, 1.0\%; p ≤ 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: A pharmacy-based intervention program reduces the incidence of inappropriate antibiotic use in the treatment of acute bronchitis. Reduced antibiotic prescribing does not increase consumption of healthcare resources; patients who receive antibiotics for acute bronchitis are more likely to subsequently require additional antibiotic prescriptions. While a significant decrease in antibiotic use was realized, other interventions are required to further reduce the prevalence of antibiotic use in acute bronchitis.},

Design Randomised controlled trial. Subjects Twelve peer review groups including 100 general practitioners with their collaborating pharmacists in the region of Utrecht, Netherlands. Intervention The intervention consisted of group education meetings, with a consensus procedure on indication for and type of antibiotics and with training in communication skills; monitoring and feedback on prescribing behaviour; group education for assistants of general practitioners and pharmacists; and education material for patients. The control group did not receive any of these elements. Main outcome measures Antibiotic prescription rates for acute symptoms of the respiratory tract and patients’ satisfaction.
Results 89 general practitioners completed the study (89\%). At baseline, prescription rates for antibiotics for respiratory tract symptoms did not differ between intervention and control group (27\% v 29\%, respectively). After nine months, the prescription rates in the intervention group fell to 23\%, whereas the control group’s rose to 37\% (mean difference in change − 12\%, 95\% confidence interval − 18.9\% to − 4.0\%). Multilevel analysis confirmed the results of the unadjusted analysis (intervention effect − 10.7\%, − 20.3\% to − 1.0\%). Patients’ satisfaction was high and did not differ in the two groups at baseline or after the intervention.
Conclusions A multiple intervention reduced prescribing rates of antibiotics for respiratory tract symptoms while maintaining a high degree of satisfaction among patients. Further research should focus on the sustainability and cost effectiveness of this intervention.},

	abstract = {Background. Antibiotic prescribing for upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) is widespread, is often inappropriate, and may contribute to antibiotic resistance among community-acquired pathogens, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae.
Methods. A multifaceted intervention involving health care professionals and patients was introduced to a small rural Utah community and included the repetitive use of printed diagnostic and treatment algorithms by professionals. Data on the quantity and class of antibiotic prescribing, which were collected from multiple sources, were measured for the intervention period (from January through June) in 2001 and compared with data for the baseline period during the same months in 2000.
Results. Medicaid claims data revealed that the percentage of patients in the community who received antibiotics for URTIs during the intervention period was 15.6\% less than that for the baseline period, whereas the percentage in the rest of rural Utah was relatively stable, with a 1.5\% decrease (P p .006). The greatest impact of the intervention was on prescribing for acute bronchitis (decreases of 56.1\% and 1.7\% in the community and rural Utah, respectively; P p .024) and on prescribing of macrolides (decreases of 13.4\% and 0.2\% in the community and rural Utah, respectively; P ! .001). Community pharmacy data likewise revealed a 17.5\% decrease in the rate of antibiotic prescribing during the intervention period (P ! .001), with the largest decrease observed for macrolide prescribing (50.9\%; P ! .001). Chart review data, in contrast, revealed no signiﬁcant decrease in the percentage of patients with URTI who were prescribed an antibiotic (3.8\%; P p .49), although there was a signiﬁcant decrease of 11.2\% in macrolide use (P p .045).
Conclusions. A multifaceted intervention involving the repetitive use of printed algorithms resulted in modest improvements in antibiotic prescribing for outpatient URTIs, although one data source did not corroborate this. However, macrolide prescribing decreased sharply, irrespective of the source of data.},

Outcomes were measured in 16 939 consultations for sore throat and 9887 consultations for urinary tract infection. Interventions Interventions were developed to overcome identified barriers to implementing the guidelines. The main components of the tailored interventions were patient educational material, computer based decision support and reminders, an increase in the fee for telephone consultations, and interactive courses for general practitioners and practice assistants. Main outcome measures Changes in rates of use of antibiotics, laboratory tests, and telephone consultations.
Results Patients in the sore throat group were 3\% less likely to receive antibiotics after the intervention. Women with symptoms of urinary tract infection in the intervention group were 5.1\% less likely to have a laboratory test ordered. No significant differences were found between the groups for the other outcomes. Large variation was found across the included practices in the rates of antibiotic prescription, use of laboratory tests and telephone consultations, and in the extent of change for all three outcome measures.

There is a lack of evidence documenting the impact of optimized antibiotic use on the rates of colonization with penicillin G–nonsusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (PNSP) in children. This study evaluates the effect of community-based intervention strategies on the prevalence of PNSP colonization
Methods. A controlled, population-based pharmacoepidemiological trial was conducted from January through May 2000. Three French geographic areas were selected on the basis of demographic similarities. Two intervention strategies were implemented: (1) reduced antibiotic use, which was achieved by not prescribing antibiotics for presumed viral respiratory tract infections (the prescription-reduction group); and (2) better adaptation of dose and duration (the dose/duration group). A control group received no intervention. The target population was children aged 3–6 years who were attending kindergarten. Oropharyngeal pneumococcus colonization and antibiotic use were monitored throughout the 5-month study.
Results. The prescription-reduction, dose/duration, and control groups included 601, 483, and 405 children, respectively. The interventions induced signiﬁcantly larger decreases in antibiotic use in the prescription-reduction group (Ϫ18.8\%) and dose/duration group (Ϫ17.1\%) than in the control group (Ϫ3.8\%), and the rates of PNSP colonization were initially similar for the 3 groups (52.5\%, 55.1\%, and 50.0\%, respectively). At the end of the 5month study, the rates of PNSP colonization were 34.5\% for the prescription-reduction group (P p .05) and 44.3\% for the dose/duration group (P p .8), compared with 46.2\% for the control group.
Conclusions. Intensive educational strategies aimed at optimizing antibiotic use can signiﬁcantly reduce the rate of PNSP colonization in areas with high resistance rates.},

	abstract = {Objective To measure the added value of CDSS when coupled with a community intervention to reduce inappropriate prescribing of antimicrobial drugs for acute respiratory tract infections. Design, Participants and Setting Cluster randomized trial that included 407 460 inhabitants and 334 primary care clinicians in 12 rural communities in Utah and Idaho (6 with 1 shared characteristic and 6 with another), and a third group of 6 communities that served as nonstudy controls. The preintervention period was January to December 2001 and the postintervention period was January 2002 to September 2003. Acute respiratory tract infection diagnoses were classified into groups based on indication for antimicrobial use. Multilevel regression methods were applied to account for the clustered design. Intervention Six communities received a community intervention alone and 6 communities received community intervention plus CDSS that were targeted toward primary care clinicians. The CDSS comprised decision support tools on paper and a handheld computer to guide diagnosis and management of acute respiratory tract infection. Main Outcome Measure Community-wide antimicrobial usage was assessed using retail pharmacy data. Diagnosis-specific antimicrobial use was compared by chart review.
Results Within CDSS communities, 71\% of primary care clinicians participated in the use of CDSS. The prescribing rate decreased from 84.1 to 75.3 per 100 personyears in the CDSS arm vs 84.3 to 85.2 in community intervention alone, and remained stable in the other communities (P=.03). A total of 13 081 acute respiratory tract infection visits were abstracted. The relative decrease in antimicrobial prescribing for visits in the antibiotics “never-indicated” category during the postintervention period was 32\% in CDSS communities and 5\% in community interventionalone communities (P=.03). Use of macrolides decreased significantly in CDSS communities but not in community intervention–alone communities.
Conclusion CDSS implemented in rural primary care settings reduced overall antimicrobial use and improved appropriateness of antimicrobial selection for acute respiratory tract infections.},

People with free medical care used 85\% more antibiotics than those required to pay some portion of their medical bills (controlling for all other variables). Antibiotic use was significantly more common among women, the very young, patients with poorer health, and persons with higher income. Use of antibiotics for viral, viral-bacterial, and bacterial conditions did not differ between free and cost-sharing insurance plans, given antibiotics were the treatment of choice.

Design: Placebo-controlled, randomized controlled trial. Setting: Ofﬁces of primary care pediatricians who are members of a regional practice-based research network. Participants: Healthy children younger than 24 months old enrolled at the time of an ofﬁce visit. Interventions: Parents of study children were randomized to receive either a pamphlet and videotape (featuring one of their child’s pediatricians) promoting the judicious use of antibiotics (intervention group) or brochures about injury prevention (control group). A total of 499 eligible children were enrolled, and data on outpatient visits during a 12-month observation period were collected. Main Outcome Measures: We compared the number of visits for upper respiratory tract infections (URIs), number of diagnoses and antibiotic prescriptions for otitis media and/or sinusitis and total number of antibiotics per patient among children in the intervention and control groups using Poisson regression analysis, adjusted for clustering into different practices.
Results: Data on 4924 visits were reviewed; 28.8\% of these visits were because of URI symptoms. The mean number of visits per study patient for URI symptoms was 2.8. Including all visits, the mean number of diagnoses of otitis media in study children was 2.1, mean number of diagnoses of otitis media and/or sinusitis was 2.3 and mean number of antibiotic prescriptions was 2.4; there were no signiﬁcant differences between children in the intervention and control groups for any of these outcomes. Overall physicians prescribed 1 or more antibiotics during 45.9\% of visits for a chief complaint of URI symptoms; 92\% of antibiotic usage in children presenting with URI symptoms was for a diagnosis of otitis media and/or sinusitis.
Conclusions: An educational intervention aimed at parents did not result in a decrease in the number of antibiotic prescriptions in their children. The use of antibiotics among children with URI symptoms was common; other interventions promoting the judicious use of these medications are needed.},

	abstract = {Objective To assess whether sharing the uncertainty of the value of antibiotics for acute bronchitis in the form of written and verbal advice affects the likelihood of patients taking antibiotics. Design Nested, single blind, randomised controlled trial. Setting Three suburban general practices in Nottingham. Participants 259 previously well adults presenting with acute bronchitis. Intervention In group A, 212 patients were judged by their general practitioner not to need antibiotics that day but were given a prescription to use if they got worse and standard verbal reassurance. Half of them (106) were also given an information leaflet. All patients in group B (47) were judged to need antibiotics and were given a prescription and encouraged to use it. Main outcome measures Antibiotic use in the next two weeks. Reconsultation for the same symptoms in the next month.
Results In group A fewer patients who received the information leaflet took antibiotics compared with those who did not receive the leaflet (49 v 63, risk ratio 0.76, 95\% confidence interval 0.59 to 0.97, P = 0.04). Numbers reconsulting were similar (11 v 14). In group B, 44 patients took the antibiotics.
Conclusion Most previously well adults with acute bronchitis were judged not to need antibiotics. Reassuring these patients and sharing the uncertainty about prescribing in a information leaflet supported by verbal advice is a safe strategy and reduces antibiotic use.},

	abstract = {Background. Acute otitis media (AOM) is a common self-limiting disease in children. Antibiotic use is controversial. Physicians in the USA and in Israel prescribe antibiotics almost universally, while physicians in other countries report good outcome without any treatment. Parents’ expectation is an important factor influencing a physician’s decision to prescribe antibiotics.
Objectives. Our aim was to assess whether a brief explanation to parents regarding the selflimited nature of AOM and the controversy regarding antibiotic prescription for the disease will influence the parents’ decision regarding antibiotics use.
Methods. Parents of the children participating in the study in two primary care clinics belonging to HMO–Clalit Health Services (CHS) in the southern district of Israel were randomly assigned to an intervention (44) and control (37) group. The intervention group received the brief explanation. The two groups received prescription for antibiotics. The subjects comprised 81 children aged 3 months to 4 years visiting the family practice clinics and diagnosed with AOM. The rate of antibiotics purchase, using the prescription given and the factors influencing the decision were evaluated.
Results. Fewer parents administered antibiotics to their children in the intervention group compared with the control group (37\% versus 63\%, respectively, P Ͻ 0.0001). Mother’s education level was the only factor found to be significantly lower in the group that eventually purchased antibiotics (P Ͻ 0.05).
Conclusions. In children with AOM, a brief explanation by the family physician to the child’s parents about the disease and the expected spontaneous recovery could decrease antibiotic use by {\textasciitilde}50\%.},

Aim To assess the effectiveness of primary care based interventions to reduce antibiotic prescribing for children with RTIs. Design and setting Systematic review.
Method MEDLINE®, Embase, CINAHL®, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane library were searched for randomised, cluster randomised, and nonrandomised studies testing educational and/or behavioural interventions to change antibiotic prescribing for children ({\textless}18 years) with RTIs. Main outcomes included change in proportion of total antibiotic prescribing or change in ‘appropriate’ prescribing for RTIs. Narrative analysis of included studies was used to identify components of effective interventions.
Results Of 6301 references identified through database searching, 17 studies were included. Interventions that combined parent education with clinician behaviour change decreased antibiotic prescribing rates by between 6–21\%; structuring the parent–clinician interaction during the consultation may further increase the effectiveness of these interventions. Automatic computerised prescribing prompts increased prescribing appropriateness, while passive information, in the form of waiting room educational materials, yielded no benefit.
Conclusion Conflicting evidence from the included studies found that interventions directed towards parents and/or clinicians can reduce rates of antibiotic prescribing. The most effective interventions target both parents and clinicians during consultations, provide automatic prescribing prompts, and promote clinician leadership in the intervention design.},

This sparked a period of methodological reﬂection that we review here and call Psychology’s Renaissance. We begin by describing how psychologists’ concerns with publication bias shifted from worrying about ﬁle-drawered studies to worrying about p-hacked analyses. We then review the methodological changes that psychologists have proposed and, in some cases, embraced. In describing how the renaissance has unfolded, we attempt to describe different points of view fairly but not neutrally, so as to identify the most promising paths forward. In so doing, we champion disclosure and preregistration, express skepticism about most statistical solutions to publication bias, take positions on the analysis and interpretation of replication failures, and contend that meta-analytical thinking increases the prevalence of false positives. Our general thesis is that the scientiﬁc practices of experimental psychologists have improved dramatically.},

This study explores patient knowledge and awareness of appropriate use of antibiotics and expectations regarding how antibiotics are used for their treatment in outpatient settings. A survey was administered to a convenience sample of patients, parents, and caregivers (n = 190) at seven primary care clinics and two urgent care locations. Fisher’s exact tests compared results by patient characteristics. Although 89\% of patients correctly believed that antibiotics work well for treating infections from bacteria, 53\% incorrectly believed that antibiotics work well for treating viral infections. Patients who incorrectly believed that antibiotics work well for treating viral infections were more than twice as likely to expect a provider to give them an antibiotic when they have a cough or common cold. Patients who completed the survey also participated in semi-structured interviews (n = 4), which were analyzed using thematic analysis. Patients reported experiencing confusion about which illnesses may be treated by antibiotics and unclear communication from clinicians about the appropriate use of antibiotics. Development of easy to understand patient educational materials can help address patients’ incorrect perceptions of appropriate antibiotic use and facilitate patient-provider communication.},

Participants primed for the common cold (Experiment 1) and cardiovascular disease (Experiment 2) were compared with participants receiving a neutral shopping prime on a modified Stroop color naming task. Main Outcome Measures: Attentional bias to illness related words was calculated as the difference between response latencies to illness words and neutral words under the prime conditions. Results: In Experiment 1, participants primed with common cold showed a response bias to words related to the common cold but not to words related to cardiovascular disease. Attentional bias among participants primed for common cold was significantly correlated with explicit illness representations assessed by the Revised Illness Perception Questionnaire. Experiment 2 replicated the findings in a different illness domain. Conclusion: Illness-specific illness schemas can be activated.},

	title = {Making good cider out of bad apples — {Signaling} expectations boosts cooperation among would-be free riders},
	abstract = {The present study investigates how group-cooperation heuristics boost voluntary contributions in a repeated public goods game. We manipulate two separate factors in a two-person public goods game: i) group composition (Selﬁsh Subjects vs. Conditional Cooperators) and ii) common knowledge about group composition (Information vs. No Information). In addition, we let the subjects signal expectations of the other’s contributions in the experiment’s second phase. Common knowledge of Selﬁsh type alone slightly dampens contributions but dramatically increases contributions when signaling of expectations is allowed. The results suggest that group-cooperation heuristics are triggered when two factors are jointly salient to the agent: (i) that there is no one to free-ride on; and (ii) that the other wants to cooperate because of (i). We highlight the potential eﬀectiveness of group-cooperation heuristics and propose solution thinking as the schema of reasoning underlying the heuristics. The high correlation between expectations and actual contributions is compatible with the existence of default preference to satisfy others’ expectations (or to avoid disappointing them), but the stark end-game eﬀect suggests that group-cooperation heuristics, at least among selﬁsh players, function ultimately to beneﬁt material self-interest rather than to just please others.},

In the second experiment, subjects may pay to avoid being tested for herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and the more highly feared type 2 (HSV-2). Subjects are three times more likely to avoid testing for HSV-2, suggesting that more aversive outcomes lead to more information avoidance. In a third experiment, subjects make choices about when to get tested for a ﬁctional disease. Some subjects behave in a way consistent with expected utility theory, and others exhibit greater delay of information for more severe diseases. We also ﬁnd that information choice is correlated with positive aﬀect, ambiguity aversion, and time preference, as some theories predict.},

Despite the advantages of Bayes factors and the drawbacks of p-values, inference by p-values is still nearly ubiquitous. One impediment to the adoption of Bayes factors is a lack of practical development, particularly a lack of ready-to-use formulas and algorithms. In this paper, we discuss and expand a set of default Bayes factor tests for ANOVA designs. These tests are based on multivariate generalizations of Cauchy priors on standardized effects, and have the desirable properties of being invariant with respect to linear transformations of measurement units. Moreover, these Bayes factors are computationally convenient, and straightforward sampling algorithms are provided. We cover models with fixed, random, and mixed effects, including random interactions, and do so for within-subject, between-subject, and mixed designs. We extend the discussion to regression models with continuous covariates. We also discuss how these Bayes factors may be applied in nonlinear settings, and show how they are useful in differentiating between the power law and the exponential law of skill acquisition. In sum, the current development makes the computation of Bayes factors straightforward for the vast majority of designs in experimental psychology.},

Objective. This study will test the hypothesis that acute cooling of the feet causes the onset of common cold symptoms.
Methods. 180 healthy subjects were randomized to receive either a foot chill or control procedure. All subjects were asked to score common cold symptoms, before and immediately after the procedures, and twice a day for 4/5 days.
Results. 13/90 subjects who were chilled reported they were suffering from a cold in the 4/5 days after the procedure compared to 5/90 control subjects (P = 0.047). There was no evidence that chilling caused any acute change in symptom scores (P = 0.62). Mean total symptom score for days 1–4 following chilling was 5.16 (±5.63 s.d. n = 87) compared to a score of 2.89 (±3.39 s.d. n = 88) in the control group (P = 0.013). The subjects who reported that they developed a cold (n = 18) reported that they suffered from significantly more colds each year (P = 0.007) compared to those subjects who did not develop a cold (n = 162).
Conclusion. Acute chilling of the feet causes the onset of common cold symptoms in around 10\% of subjects who are chilled. Further studies are needed to determine the relationship of symptom generation to any respiratory infection.},

Design, Setting, and Participants Statewide enhanced public health surveillance of California residents who were hospitalized or died with laboratory evidence of pandemic 2009 influenza A(H1N1) infection reported to the California Department of Public Health between April 23 and August 11, 2009. Main Outcome Measure Characteristics of hospitalized and fatal cases.
Results During the study period there were 1088 cases of hospitalization or death due to pandemic 2009 influenza A(H1N1) infection reported in California. The median age was 27 years (range, Ͻ1-92 years) and 68\% (741/1088) had risk factors for seasonal influenza complications. Sixty-six percent (547/833) of those with chest radiographs performed had infiltrates and 31\% (340/1088) required intensive care. Rapid antigen tests were falsely negative in 34\% (208/618) of cases evaluated. Secondary bacterial infection was identified in 4\% (46/1088). Twenty-one percent (183/884) received no antiviral treatment. Overall fatality was 11\% (118/1088) and was highest (18\%-20\%) in persons aged 50 years or older. The most common causes of death were viral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Conclusions In the first 16 weeks of the current pandemic, the median age of hospitalized infected cases was younger than is common with seasonal influenza. Infants had the highest hospitalization rates and persons aged 50 years or older had the highest mortality rates once hospitalized. Most cases had established risk factors for complications of seasonal influenza.},

	abstract = {Objectives: Previous work based on guidelines and expert opinion identiﬁed ‘ideal’ prescribing proportions—the overall proportion of consultations that should result in an antibiotic prescription—for common infectious conditions. Here, actual condition-speciﬁc prescribing proportions in primary care in England were compared with ideal prescribing proportions identiﬁed by experts.
Methods: All recorded consultations for common infectious conditions (cough, bronchitis, exacerbations of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, sore throat, rhinosinusitis, otitis media, lower respiratory tract infection, upper respiratory tract infection, inﬂuenza-like illness, urinary tract infection, impetigo, acne, gastroenteritis) for 2013–15 were extracted from The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database. The proportions of consultations resulting in an antibiotic prescription were established, concentrating on acute presentations in patients without relevant comorbidities. These actual prescribing proportions were then compared with previously established ‘ideal’ proportions by condition.
Results: For most conditions, substantially higher proportions of consultations resulted in an antibiotic prescription than was deemed appropriate according to expert opinion. An antibiotic was prescribed in 41\% of all acute cough consultations when experts advocated 10\%. For other conditions the proportions were: bronchitis (actual 82\% versus ideal 13\%); sore throat (actual 59\% versus ideal 13\%); rhinosinusitis (actual 88\% versus ideal 11\%); and acute otitis media in 2- to 18-year-olds (actual 92\% versus ideal 17\%). Substantial variation between practices was found.
Conclusions: This work has identiﬁed substantial overprescribing of antibiotics in English primary care, and highlights conditions where this is most pronounced, particularly in respiratory tract conditions.},

	abstract = {Purpose Patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) are at markedly increased risk of coronary artery disease. Regular participation in three self-management behaviors, physical activity, healthy eating, and adherence to medication, can significantly reduce this risk in FH patients. We aimed to predict intentions to engage in these self-management behaviors in FH patients using a multi-theory, integrated model that makes the distinction between beliefs about illness and beliefs about self-management behaviors. Methods Using a cross-sectional, correlational design, patients (N = 110) diagnosed with FH from a clinic in Perth, Western Australia self-completed a questionnaire that measured constructs from three health-behavior theories: the common sense model of illness representations (serious consequences, timeline, personal control, treatment control, illness coherence, emotional representations), theory of planned behavior (attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control), and social cognitive theory (self-efficacy).
Results Structural equation models for each self-management behavior revealed consistent and statistically significant effects of attitudes on intentions across the three behaviors. Subjective norms predicted intentions for health eating only and self-efficacy predicted intentions for physical activity only. There were no effects for the perceived behavioral control and common sense model constructs in any model.
Conclusions Attitudes feature prominently in determining intentions to engage in selfmanagement behaviors in FH patients. The prominence of these attitudinal beliefs about selfmanagement behaviors, as opposed to illness beliefs, suggest that addressing these beliefs may be a priority in the management of FH.},

This approach to drawing conclusions from data, however, has been widely criticized, and two types of remedies have been advocated. The first proposal is to supplement p values with complementary measures of evidence, such as effect sizes. The second is to replace inference with Bayesian measures of evidence, such as the Bayes factor. The authors provide a practical comparison of p values, effect sizes, and default Bayes factors as measures of statistical evidence, using 855 recently published t tests in psychology. The comparison yields two main results. First, although p values and default Bayes factors almost always agree about what hypothesis is better supported by the data, the measures often disagree about the strength of this support; for 70\% of the data sets for which the p value falls between .01 and .05, the default Bayes factor indicates that the evidence is only anecdotal. Second, effect sizes can provide additional evidence to p values and default Bayes factors. The authors conclude that the Bayesian approach is comparatively prudent, preventing researchers from overestimating the evidence in favor of an effect.},

	abstract = {The Cognitive Reflection Test, measuring intuition inhibition and cognitive reflection, has become extremely popular because it reliably predicts reasoning performance, decision-making, and beliefs. Across studies, the response format of CRT items sometimes differs, based on the assumed construct equivalence of tests with open-ended versus multiple-choice items (the equivalence hypothesis). Evidence and theoretical reasons, however, suggest that the cognitive processes measured by these response formats and their associated performances might differ (the nonequivalence hypothesis). We tested the two hypotheses experimentally by assessing the performance in tests with different response formats and by comparing their predictive and construct validity. In a between-subjects experiment (n = 452), participants answered stem-equivalent CRT items in an open-ended, a two-option, or a four-option response format and then completed tasks on belief bias, denominator neglect, and paranormal beliefs (benchmark indicators of predictive validity), as well as on actively open-minded thinking and numeracy (benchmark indicators of construct validity). We found no significant differences between the three response formats in the numbers of correct responses, the numbers of intuitive responses (with the exception of the two-option version, which had a higher number than the other tests), and the correlational patterns of the indicators of predictive and construct validity. All three test versions were similarly reliable, but the multiple-choice formats were completed more quickly. We speculate that the specific nature of the CRT items helps build construct equivalence among the different response formats. We recommend using the validated multiple-choice version of the CRT presented here, particularly the four-option CRT, for practical and methodological reasons.

Apparent competence and morality were positively related to both interest and quality judgments, whereas attractiveness boosted interest but decreased perceived quality.

	abstract = {Background: Antimicrobial drug resistance is a signiﬁcant cause of avoidable morbidity and mortality. Inappropriate prescribing of antimicrobials is acknowledged as a key determinant of this phenomenon. Many approaches are advocated for reducing this inappropriate prescribing, including regulatory, professional and educational interventions. Mass media campaigns are often suggested as a useful tool in managing public expectations, but the evidence to support this is weak, as no controlled studies of such campaigns exist. Evaluating such campaigns is problematic, and uncontrolled observations are misleading. We report here the ﬁrst controlled study of such an intervention in the use of antimicrobials.
Methods: Two sequential mass media campaigns, providing information on the appropriate use of antimicrobials, were conducted during early 2004 and 2005 in the North East of England. These messages were articulated in the campaign by the cartoon character ‘Moxy Malone’. The campaigns were supported by printed materials, and in parts of this area, with professional education and prescribing support. A retrospective controlled before– after study was conducted, examining the effects on observed prescribing of antimicrobials for the populations covered by these two cycles of mass media campaigns. These populations were controlled with matched populations in the North of England. The primary outcome examined was prescribing rates (items) for all microbial agents for these populations, corrected for population structure (STAR-PU). A repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to analyse factors that had a possible effect on the prescribing of antibacterial drugs. This was supported by a survey of primary care organizations (PCOs) of all interventions undertaken around antimicrobial use in the intervention and comparison populations.
Results: In this retrospective study, there was incomplete reporting of adjuvant interventions undertaken by the PCOs intervention and comparison areas, so isolating the intervention, and attributing cause and effect is difﬁcult. In this pragmatic evaluation the campaign was found to signiﬁcantly reduce the volume of antibacterial drugs during the winter months of the intervention years. There were 21.7 fewer items prescribed per 1000 population (P {\textless} 0.0005), for the intervention populations over these winter months, equivalent to a 5.8\% absolute reduction in prescribing.
Conclusions: Mass media campaigns have a role in changing antimicrobial prescribing practice.},

	abstract = {Antibiotic resistance is a collective action dilemma. Individuals may request antibiotics, but an overall reduction in use is necessary to limit resistance. A reoccurring theoretical claim is that social capital increase cooperation in social dilemmas. The aim of this paper is to investigate the link between generalized trust and reciprocity and the willingness to postpone antibiotic treatment in order to limit overuse in a scenario-based study. A between-subject scenario experimental approach with hypothetical scenarios was utilized. Participants were asked to imagine that they were seeing a doctor for a respiratory infection. The doctor prescribes antibiotics, but advise postponing therapy to see if the disease resolves by itself, for the sake of limiting overuse. Respondents were asked to answer how long they could accept postponing antibiotic treatment, from 0 to 7 days. The number of days that most people would be able to accept postponing treatment was considered the between-subject factor. In total, the study sample included 981 respondents with a mean age of 51 years. A majority of respondents were men (65.7\%). The mean number of days that the respondents stated they were willing to postpone antibiotic treatment was positively associated with the number of days the respondents were told that most people were willing to postpone antibiotic treatment, p {\textless} 0.001. There was a positive association between number of days they were willing to postpone antibiotic treatment and generalized trust, p ¼ 0.001. In conclusion, the results showed that the proclaimed public willingness to postpone therapy inﬂuenced a respondent's willingness to postpone antibiotic therapy in different scenarios. Also, generalized trust was positively associated with the willingness to postpone therapy.},

	abstract = {Human overuse of antibiotics is the main driver of antibiotic resistance. Thus, more knowledge about factors that promote sustainable antibiotic use is urgently needed. Based upon ﬁndings from the management of other sustainability and collective action dilemmas, we hypothesize that interpersonal trust is crucial for people’s propensity to cooperate for the common objective. The aim of this article is to further our understanding of people’s antibiotic consumption by investigating if individuals’ willingness to voluntarily abstain from antibiotic use is linked to interpersonal trust. To fulﬁll the aim, we implement two empirical investigations. In the ﬁrst part, we use cross-section survey data to investigate the link between interpersonal trust and willingness to abstain from using antibiotics. The second part is based on a survey experiment in which we study the indirect effect of trust on willingness to abstain from using antibiotics by experimentally manipulating the proclaimed trustworthiness of other people to abstain from antibiotics. We ﬁnd that interpersonal trust is linked to abstemiousness, also when controlling for potential confounders. The survey experiment demonstrates that trustworthiness stimulates individuals to abstain from using antibiotics. In conclusion, trust is an important asset for preserving effective antibiotics for future generations, as well as for reaching many of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals.},

	abstract = {Reducing inappropriate prescribing is key to mitigating antibiotic resistance, particularly in acute care settings. Clinicians’ prescribing decisions are influenced by their judgments and actual or perceived patient expectations. Fuzzy trace theory predicts that patients and clinicians base such decisions on categorical gist representations that reflect the bottom-line understanding of information about antibiotics. However, due to clinicians’ specialized training, the categorical gists driving clinicians’ and patients’ decisions might differ, which could result in mismatched expectations and inefficiencies in targeting interventions. We surveyed clinicians and patients from 2 large urban academic hospital emergency departments (EDs) and a sample of nonpatient subjects regarding their gist representations of antibiotic decisions, as well as relevant knowledge and expectations. Results were analyzed using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and multifactor regression. In total, 149 clinicians (47\% female; 74\% white), 519 online subjects (45\% female; 78\% white), and 225 ED patients (61\% female; 56\% black) completed the survey. While clinicians demonstrated greater knowledge of antibiotics and concern about side effects than patients, the predominant categorical gist for both patients and clinicians was ‘‘why not take a risk,’’ which compares the status quo of remaining sick to the possibility of benefit from antibiotics. This gist also predicted expectations and prior prescribing in the nonpatient sample. Other representations reflected the gist that ‘‘germs are germs’’ conflating bacteria and viruses, as well as perceptions of side effects and efficacy. Although individually rational, reliance on the ‘‘why not take a risk’’ representation can lead to socially suboptimal results, including antibiotic resistance and individual patient harm due to adverse events. Changing this representation could alter clinicians’ and patients’ expectations, suggesting opportunities to reduce overprescribing.},

They involve perceptual uncertainty (e.g., a scowling face might indicate anger or concentration, for which different responses are appropriate) and behavioral risk (e.g., a cost to making the wrong response). Signal detection theory describes these types of decisions. In this tutorial, we show how incorporating the economic concept of utility allows signal detection theory to serve as a model of optimal decision making, going beyond its common use as an analytic method. This utility approach to signal detection theory clarifies otherwise enigmatic influences of perceptual uncertainty on measures of decision-making performance (accuracy and optimality) and on behavior (an inverse relationship between bias magnitude and sensitivity optimizes utility). A “utilized” signal detection theory offers the possibility of expanding the phenomena that can be understood within a decision-making framework.},

	abstract = {People’s trust in the health system plays a role in explaining one’s access to and utilization of medical care, adherence to medications, continuity of care, and even self-reported health status. Yet it is not easy to ﬁnd trust measures and understand what they are measuring. A systematic review of scales and indices identiﬁed 45 measures of trust within the health system with an average of 12 questions each, which quantiﬁed levels of trust among various relationships across the health system. Existing evidence was narrow in scope, where half examined the relationship between doctors/nurses and patients, and the majority were designed, tested and validated in the United States. We developed a health systems trust content area framework, where we identiﬁed that honesty, communication, conﬁdence and competence were captured frequently in these measures, with less focus on concepts such as ﬁdelity, system trust, conﬁdentiality and fairness. Half of the measures employed a qualitative method in the design of these measures and 33\% were pilot tested. Reporting of testeretest reliability and inter-rater reliability were less common. This review identiﬁes a need to develop measurements of trust beyond doctorepatient relationships and outside of U.S. contexts, and strengthen the rigor of existing trust measures. Greater development and use of trust measures in the health system could improve monitoring and evaluation efforts, which may in turn result in better health outcomes.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE Mutual trust is an important aspect of the patient-physician relationship with positive consequences for both parties. Previous measures have been limited to patient trust in the physician. We set out to develop and validate a measure of physician trust in the patient.
METHODS We identified candidate items for the scale by content analysis of a previous qualitative study of patient-physician trust and developed and validated a scale among 61 primary care clinicians (50 physicians and 11 nonphysicians) with respect to 168 patients as part of a community-based study of prescription opioid use for chronic, nonmalignant pain in HIV-positive adults. Polychoric factor structure analysis using the Pratt D matrix was used to reduce the number of items and describe the factor structure. Construct validity was tested by comparing mean clinician trust scores for patients by clinician and patient behaviors expected to be associated with clinician trust using a generalized linear mixed model.
RESULTS The final 12-item scale had high internal reliability (Cronbach α = .93) and a distinct 2-factor pattern with the Pratt matrix D. Construct validity was demonstrated with respect to clinician-reported self-behaviors including toxicology screening (P {\textless}.001), and refusal to prescribe opioids (P {\textless}.001) and with patient behaviors including reporting opioids lost or stolen (P = .008), taking opioids to get high (P {\textless}.001), and selling opioids (P {\textless}.001).
CONCLUSIONS If validated in other populations, this measure of physician trust in the patient will be useful in investigating the antecedents and consequences of mutual trust, and the relationship between mutual trust and processes of care, which can help improve the delivery of clinical care.},

DESIGN: Survey of patients of physicians in Atlanta, Georgia. PATIENTS: Subjects were 292 patients aged 18 years and older.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Scale of patients’ trust in their physician was the main outcome measure. Most patients completely trusted their physicians “to put their needs above all other considerations” (69\%). Patients who reported having enough choice of physician (p Ͻ .05), a longer relationship with the physician (p Ͻ .001), and who trusted their managed care organization (p Ͻ .001) were more likely to trust their physician. Approximately two thirds of all respondents did not know the method by which their physician was paid. The majority of patients believed paying a physician each time a test is done rather than a fixed monthly amount would not affect their care (72.4\%). However, 40.5\% of all respondents believed paying a physician more for ordering fewer than the average number of tests would make their care worse. Of these patients, 53.3\% would accept higher copayments to obtain necessary medical tests.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients’ trust in their physician is related to having a choice of physicians, having a longer relationship with their physician, and trusting their managed care organization. Most patients are unaware of their physician’s payment method, but many are concerned about payment methods that might discourage medical use.},

Methods. Analyses of self reported data from 713 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, or ﬁbromyalgia. Study variables included the Trust in Physician Scale, a decision-making question, a medical skepticism measure, and demographic and health-related measures. Internal consistency and construct validity were assessed using correlational analyses and factor analysis. A regression analysis was conducted to identify factors associated with trust in the rheumatologist.
Results. Internal consistency of the scale was high (Cronbach’s alpha ؍ 0.87). Scale items also loaded on a single factor. Construct validity was supported by inverse correlations between higher trust scores and both skepticism and independent decision making. Decreased trust was associated with older age, minority status, higher education, diagnosis of ﬁbromyalgia or osteoarthritis, and poorer health.
Conclusion. The Trust in Physician Scale is appropriate for patients with rheumatic disease. Several patient characteristics appear to be associated with lower trust in the rheumatologist.},

	abstract = {Background: Despite the recent proliferation in research on patient trust, it is seldom a primary outcome, and is often a peripheral area of interest. The length of our original scales to measure trust may limit their use because of the practical needs to minimize both respondent burden and research cost. The objective of this study was to develop three abbreviated scales to measure trust in: (1) a physician, (2) a health insurer, and (3) the medical profession.
Methods: Data from two samples were used. The first was a telephone survey of English-speaking adults in the United States (N = 1117) and the second was a telephone survey of English-speaking adults residing in North Carolina who were members of a health maintenance organization (N = 1024). Data were analyzed to examine data completeness, scaling assumptions, internal consistency properties, and factor structure.
Results: Abbreviated measures (5-items) were developed for each of the three scales. Cronbach's alpha was 0.87 for trust in a physician (test-retest reliability = 0.71), 0.84 for trust in a health insurer (test-retest reliability = 0.73), and 0.77 for trust in the medical profession.
Conclusion: Assessment of data completeness, scale score dispersion characteristics, reliability and validity test results all provide evidence for the soundness of the abbreviated 5-item scales.},

	abstract = {Over the last decades, trust in physician has gained in importance. Studies have shown that trust in physician is associated with positive health behaviors in patients. However, the validity of empirical findings fundamentally depends on the quality of the measures in use. Our aim was to provide an overview of trust in physician measures and to evaluate the methodological quality of the psychometric studies and the quality of psychometric properties of identified measures. We conducted an electronic search in three databases (Medline, EMBASE and PsycInfo). The secondary search strategy included reference and citation tracking of included full texts and consultation of experts in the field. Retrieved records were screened independently by two reviewers. Full texts that reported on testing of psychometric properties of trust in physician measures were included in the review. Study characteristics and psychometric properties were extracted. We evaluated the quality of design, methods and reporting of studies with the COnsensus based Standards for the selection of health status Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) checklist. The quality of psychometric properties was assessed with Terwee’s 2007 quality criteria. After screening 3284 records and assessing 169 full texts for eligibility, fourteen studies on seven trust in physician measures were included. Most of the studies were conducted in the USA and used English measures. All but one measure were generic. Sample sizes range from 25 to 1199 participants, recruited in very heterogeneous settings. Quality assessments revealed several flaws in the methodological quality of studies. COSMIN scores were mainly fair or poor. The overall quality of measures’ psychometric properties was intermediate. Several trust in physician measures have been developed over the last years, but further psychometric evaluation of these measures is strongly recommended. The methodological quality of psychometric property studies could be improved by adhering to quality criteria like the COSMIN checklist.},

	abstract = {Background: Patient trust in physicians, which can be considered a collective good, is necessary for an effective health care system. However, there is a widespread concern that patient trust in physicians is declining under various threats to the physician–patient relationship worldwide. This article aimed to assess patient trust in physicians through a quantitative study in Shanghai, China, and to provide appropriate suggestions for improving the trust in China.
Methods: The data from a survey conducted in Zhongshan Hospital and Shanghai Tenth People’s Hospital, which are two tertiary public hospitals in Shanghai, were used in this study. Patient trust in physicians was the dependent variable. Furthermore, a 10‑item scale was used to precisely describe the dependent variable. The demographic characteristics were independent variables of trust in physicians. Binomial logistic regression was employed to analyze the factors associated with the dependent variable, which was divided into two categories on the basis of the responses (1: Strongly agree or agree and 0: Strongly disagree, disagree, or neutral).
Results: This study found that 67\% of patients trusted or strongly trusted physicians. The mean score of patient trust in physicians was 35.4 from a total score of 50. Furthermore, patient trust in physicians was significantly correlated with the age, education level, annual income, and health insurance coverage of the patients.
Conclusions: Patient trust in physicians in Shanghai, China is higher than previously reported. Furthermore, the most crucial reason for patient distrust in physicians is the information asymmetry between patients and physicians, which is a natural property of the physician–patient relationship, rather than the so‑called for‑profit characteristic of physicians or patients’ excessive expectations.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12913-016-1867-7},
	abstract = {Background: Trust is critical to generate and maintain demand for vaccines in low and middle income countries. However, there is little documentation on how health system insufficiencies affect trust in vaccination and the process of re-building trust once it has been compromised. We reflect on how disruptions to immunizations systems can affect trust in vaccination and can compromise vaccine utilization. We then explore key pathways for overcoming system vulnerabilities in order to restore trust, to strengthen the resilience of health systems and communities, and to promote vaccine utilization.
Methods: Utilizing secondary data and a review of the literature, we developed a causal loop diagram (CLD) to map the determinants of building trust in immunizations. Using the CLD, we devised three scenarios to illustrate common vulnerabilities that compromise trust and pathways to strengthen trust and utilization of vaccines, specifically looking at weak health systems, harmful communication channels, and role of social capital. Spill-over effects, interactions and other dynamics in the CLD were then examined to assess leverage points to counter these vulnerabilities.
Results: Trust in vaccination arises from the interactions among experiences with the health system, the various forms of communication and social capital – both external and internal to communities. When experiencing system-wide shocks such as the case in Ebola-affected countries, distrust is reinforced by feedback between the health and immunization systems where distrust often lingers even after systems are restored and spills over beyond vaccination in the broader health system. Vaccine myths or anti-vaccine movements reinforce distrust. Social capital – the collective value of social networks of community members – plays a central role in increasing levels of trust.
Conclusions: Trust is important, yet underexplored, in the context of vaccine utilization. Using a CLD to illustrate various scenarios helped to explore how common health and vaccine vulnerabilities can reinforce and spill over distrust through vicious, reinforcing feedback. Restoring trust requires a careful balance between eliminating vulnerabilities and strengthening social capital and interactions among communication channels.},

	abstract = {Background/study context: Recent studies have shown that young adults better remember factual information they are curious about. It is not entirely clear, however, whether this eﬀect is retained during aging. Here, the authors investigated curiosity-driven memory beneﬁts in young and elderly individuals.
Methods: In two experiments, young (age range 18–26) and older (age range 65–89) adults read trivia questions and rated their curiosity to ﬁnd out the answer. They also attended to task-irrelevant faces presented between the trivia question and the answer. The authors then administered a surprise memory test to assess recall accuracy for trivia answers and recognition memory performance for the incidentally learned faces.
Results: In both young and elderly adults, recall performance was higher for answers to questions that elicited high levels of curiosity. In Experiment 1, the authors also found that faces presented in temporal proximity to curiosity-eliciting trivia questions were better recognized, indicating that the beneﬁcial eﬀects of curiosity extended to the encoding of task-irrelevant material.
Conclusions: These ﬁndings show that elderly individuals beneﬁt from the memory-enhancing eﬀects of curiosity. This may lead to the implementation of learning strategies that target and stimulate curiosity in aging.},

Results of 4 experiments supported these hypotheses. The first 2 experiments revealed that participants detected another person’s trait of self-control. Experiments 3 and 4 revealed that participants also detected the temporary depletion of another person’s self-control. Confirming the authors’ predictions, perceived trait and state self-control, in turn, influenced people’s judgment of the other person’s trustworthiness.

Methods: The paper presents a brief history of the study of the physician-patient relationship, and discusses constructs that have examined aspects of the relationship, such as empathy, trust, and shared decision-making. Lastly, a meta-analysis was conducted based on the seven empirical studies (a total N of 1023 patients) that have examined the physician-patient working alliance.
Results: Results of the meta-analysis found medium to large effect sizes between the working alliance and various behavioral care indices. The working alliance is positively associated with patient adherence, satisfaction, and improved patient outcomes.
Conclusion: Overall, the physician-patient working alliance provides researchers and medical-care providers with a uniﬁed construct that combines cognitive and affective dimensions inherent in the relationship in medical care. Furthermore, the PPWAI provides an efﬁcient and inexpensive way to assess the physician-patient relationship in medical treatment.},

However, a growing theoretical and experimental literature suggests that information may directly enter the agent's utility function. This can create an incentive to avoid information, even when it is useful, free, and independent of strategic considerations. We review research documenting the occurrence of information avoidance, as well as theoretical and empirical research on reasons why people avoid information, drawing from economics, psychology, and other disciplines. The review concludes with a discussion of some of the diverse (and often costly) individual and societal consequences of information avoidance. (JEL D82, D83)},

Search results can contain documents that present incorrect information that contradicts current established medical understanding on whether a treatment is helpful or not for a health issue. If people are influenced by the incorrect information found in search results, they can make harmful decisions about the appropriate treatment. To determine the extent to which people can be influenced by search engine results, we conducted a controlled laboratory study that biased search results towards correct or incorrect information for 10 different medical treatments. We found that search engine results can significantly influence people both positively and negatively. Importantly, study participants made more incorrect decisions when they interacted with search results biased towards incorrect information than when they had no interaction with search results at all. For search domains such as health information, search engine designers and researchers must recognize that not all non-relevant information is the same. Some non-relevant information is incorrect and potentially harmful when people use it to make decisions that may negatively impact their lives.},

	abstract = {Screening is important for early detection of colorectal cancer. Our aim was to determine whether a simple anticipated regret (AR) intervention could increase uptake of colorectal cancer screening. A randomised controlled trial of a simple, questionnaire-based AR intervention, delivered alongside existing pre-notification letters, was conducted. A total of 60,000 adults aged 50–74 years from the Scottish National Screening programme were randomised into the following groups: (1) no questionnaire (control), (2) Health Locus of Control questionnaire (HLOC) or (3) HLOC plus AR questionnaire. The primary outcome was return of the guaiac faecal occult blood test (FOBT). The secondary outcomes included intention to return test kit and perceived disgust (ICK). A total of 59,366 people were analysed as allocated (intention to treat (ITT)); no overall differences were seen between the treatment groups on FOBT uptake (control: 57.3\%, HLOC: 56.9\%, AR: 57.4\%). As many as 13,645 (34.2\%) individuals returned the questionnaires. Analysis of the secondary questionnaire measures showed that AR indirectly affected FOBT uptake via intention, whilst ICK directly affected FOBT uptake over and above intention. The effect of AR on FOBT uptake was also moderated by intention strength: for less-than-strong intenders only, uptake was 4.2\% higher in the AR (84.6\%) versus the HLOC group (80.4\%) (95\% CI for difference (2.0, 6.5)). The findings show that psychological concepts including AR and perceived disgust (ICK) are important factors that determine FOBT uptake. However, the AR intervention had no simple effect on the ITT. It can be concluded that those with low intentions may need more exposure to AR to increase FOBT uptake. The current controlled trials are presented at the website www.controlled-trials.com (number: ISRCTN74986452).},

It is not entirely clear, however, whether this eﬀect is retained during aging. Here, the authors investigated curiosity-driven memory beneﬁts in young and elderly individuals.
Methods: In two experiments, young (age range 18–26) and older (age range 65–89) adults read trivia questions and rated their curiosity to ﬁnd out the answer. They also attended to task-irrelevant faces presented between the trivia question and the answer. The authors then administered a surprise memory test to assess recall accuracy for trivia answers and recognition memory performance for the incidentally learned faces.
Results: In both young and elderly adults, recall performance was higher for answers to questions that elicited high levels of curiosity. In Experiment 1, the authors also found that faces presented in temporal proximity to curiosity-eliciting trivia questions were better recognized, indicating that the beneﬁcial eﬀects of curiosity extended to the encoding of task-irrelevant material.
Conclusions: These ﬁndings show that elderly individuals beneﬁt from the memory-enhancing eﬀects of curiosity. This may lead to the implementation of learning strategies that target and stimulate curiosity in aging.},

Doing so not only provides additional information, but also increases the psychological impact of information on utility – an impact effect – and increases the speed of a utility reference point adjustment – a reference point updating effect. The main prediction of the model is that investors will check the value of their portfolios more frequently in rising markets but will “put their heads in the sand” when markets are flat or falling. We test and find support for this prediction with three Scandinavian data sets.},

	abstract = {Background. ‘‘I don’t know’’ (DK) responses are common in health behavior research. Yet analytic approaches to managing DK responses may undermine survey validity and researchers’ ability to interpret findings. Objective. Compare the usefulness of a methodological strategy for reducing DK responses to 3 analytic approaches: 1) excluding DKs as missing data, 2) recoding them to the neutral point of the response scale, and 3) recoding DKs with the mean. Methods. We used a 4-group design to compare a methodological strategy, which encourages use of the response scale after an initial DK response, to 3 methods of analytically treating DK responses. We examined 1) whether this methodological strategy reduced the frequency of DK responses, and 2) how the methodological strategy compared to common analytic treatments in terms of factor structure and strength of correlations between measures of constructs. Results. The prompt reduced DK response frequency (55.7\% of 164 unprompted participants vs. 19.6\% of 102 prompted participants). Factorial invariance analyses suggested equivalence in factor loadings for all constructs throughout the groups. Compared to excluding DKs, recoding strategies and use of the prompt improved the strength of correlations between constructs, with the prompt resulting in the strongest correlations (.589 for benefits and intentions, .446 for perceived susceptibility and intentions, and .329 for benefits and perceived susceptibility). Limitations. This study was not designed a priori to test methods for addressing DK responses. Our analysis was limited to an interviewer-administered survey, and interviewers did not probe about reasons for DK responses. Conclusion. Findings suggest that use of a prompt to reduce DK responses is preferable to analytic approaches to treating DK responses. Use of such prompts may improve the validity of health behavior survey research.},

Patients and methods: A descriptive study linking individual patient data on diagnosis and prescription in a large primary care database, covering 537 UK general practices during 1995 –2011.
Results: The proportion of cough/cold episodes for which antibiotics were prescribed decreased from 47\% in 1995 to 36\% in 1999, before increasing to 51\% in 2011. There was marked variation by primary care practice in 2011 [10th – 90th percentile range (TNPR) 32\% – 65\%]. Antibiotic prescribing for sore throats fell from 77\% in 1995 to 62\% in 1999 and then stayed broadly stable (TNPR 45\% –78\%). Where antibiotics were prescribed for sore throat, recommended antibiotics were used in 69\% of cases in 2011 (64\% in 1995). The use of recommended short-course trimethoprim for urinary tract infection (UTI) in women aged 16–74 years increased from 8\% in 1995 to 50\% in 2011; however, a quarter of practices prescribed short courses in ≤16\% of episodes in 2011. For otitis media, 85\% of prescriptions were for recommended antibiotics in 2011, increasing from 77\% in 1995. All these changes in annual prescribing were highly statistically signiﬁcant (P,0.001).
Conclusions: The implementation of national guidelines in UK primary care has had mixed success, with prescribing for coughs/colds, both in total and as a proportion of consultations, now being greater than before recommendations were made to reduce it. Extensive variation by practice suggests that there is signiﬁcant scope to improve prescribing, particularly for coughs/colds and for UTIs.},

	abstract = {Objectives: Patients’ trust in general practitioners (GPs) is fundamental to effective clinical encounters. Associations between patients’ trust and their perceptions of communication within the consultation have been identified, but the influence of patients’ demographic characteristics on these associations is unknown. We aimed to investigate the relative contribution of the patient’s age, gender and ethnicity in any association between patients’ ratings of interpersonal aspects of the consultation and their confidence and trust in the doctor. Design: Secondary analysis of English national GP patient survey data (2009). Setting: Primary Care, England, UK. Participants: Data from year 3 of the GP patient survey: 5 660 217 questionnaires sent to patients aged 18 and over, registered with a GP in England for at least 6 months; overall response rate was 42\% after adjustment for sampling design. Outcome measures: We used binary logistic regression analysis to investigate patients’ reported confidence and trust in the GP, analysing ratings of 7 interpersonal aspects of the consultation, controlling for patients’ sociodemographic characteristics. Further modelling examined moderating effects of age, gender and ethnicity on the relative importance of these 7 predictors.
Results: Among 1.5 million respondents (adjusted response rate 42\%), the sense of ‘being taken seriously’ had the strongest association with confidence and trust. The relative importance of the 7 interpersonal aspects of care was similar for men and women. Non-white patients accorded higher priority to being given enough time than did white patients. Involvement in decisions regarding their care was more strongly associated with reports of confidence and trust for older patients than for younger patients.
Conclusions: Associations between patients’ ratings of interpersonal aspects of care and their confidence and trust in their GP are influenced by patients’ demographic characteristics. Taking account of these findings could inform patient-centred service design and delivery and potentially enhance patients’ confidence and trust in their doctor.},

	abstract = {Background. Patient trust is a key component of the patient–physician relationship. A previous qualitative study has suggested that a low level of trust is associated with unfulfilled requests.
Objective. Our aim was to test the hypothesis that patients with a low level of trust will be more likely to report that requested or needed services were not provided during an office visit.
Methods. An observational study was carried out of office visits by 732 patients of 45 physicians (16 family physicians, 18 general internists and 11 cardiologists), within two managed care settings. Participants were consecutive, English-speaking patients, age 18 and older who had a significant health concern. Visit questionnaires were completed by 68\% of patients known to be eligible. Post-visit measures included services requested (information, examination, prescription, test or referral); services provided; and requested or needed services not provided during the visit. Measures at 2-week follow-up included patient satisfaction, intended adherence to advice, interval contacts with the health system and symptom improvement.
Results. After adjustment for patient and physician characteristics, patient trust in the physician was not associated with the likelihood that a service was requested or provided during the visit, with the exception that prescription of a new medication was more frequent among patients with higher trust. In contrast, patients with low trust prior to the visit consistently were more likely to report that a needed or requested service was not provided (P Ͻ 0.001 for all services). Patients with a low level of trust were less satisfied with their care (P Ͻ 0.001), were less likely to intend to follow the doctor’s advice (P Ͻ 0.001) and were less likely to report symptom improvement at 2 weeks (P = 0.03).
Conclusions. Patients with a lower level of trust in their physician are more likely to report that requested or needed services are not provided. Understanding this relationship may lead to better ways of responding to patient requests that preserve or enhance patient trust, leading to better outcomes.},

Methods: A quantitative, cross-sectional interview study based on a structured questionnaire used during telephone interviews. The sample comprised 1000 randomly selected individuals aged 21–80 years throughout Sweden. Demographic data as well as level of agreement with various statements concerning antibiotics and antibiotic use were provided by the respondents.
Results: The response rate was 74.7\%. Of the respondents, 19.1\% agreed that antibiotics cure common colds more quickly; this belief was higher in those who had not previously received antibiotics. A high proportion, 80.7\%, agreed that bacteria could become resistant to antibiotics. Trust in doctors was high, and signiﬁcantly more respondents reported trusting the doctor not prescribing an antibiotic, 87.0\%, than the doctor prescribing an antibiotic, 81.0\%. The respondents showed some confusion surrounding the terms ‘bacteria’ and ‘viruses’, and the meaning of these in relation to the prescribing decision.
Conclusions: The high level of trust in restrictive prescribing as well as the awareness of antibiotic resistance expressed by the Swedish public should be recognized by health professionals and utilized in future campaigns.},

While intervention physicians showed a net improvement in 16 of 19 speciﬁc patient-reported behaviours when compared to control physicians, these differences were not statistically signiﬁcant. There was also no signiﬁcant difference in patient trust, patient satisfaction, continuity, self-reported adherence, number of referrals or number of diagnostic tests ordered.

	abstract = {Background: Increasing the cultural competence of physicians and other health care providers has been suggested as one mechanism for reducing health disparities by improving the quality of care across racial/ethnic groups. While cultural competency training for physicians is increasingly promoted, relatively few studies evaluating the impact of training have been published.
Methods: We recruited 53 primary care physicians at 4 diverse practice sites and enrolled 429 of their patients with diabetes and/or hypertension. Patients completed a baseline survey which included a measure of physician culturally competent behaviors. Cultural competency training was then provided to physicians at 2 of the sites. At all 4 sites, physicians received feedback in the form of their aggregated cultural competency scores compared to the aggregated scores from other physicians in the practice. The primary outcome at 6 months was change in the Patient-Reported Physician Cultural Competence (PRPCC) score; secondary outcomes were changes in patient trust, satisfaction, weight, systolic blood pressure, and glycosylated hemoglobin. Multiple analysis of variance was used to control for differences patient characteristics and baseline levels of the outcome measure between groups.
Results: Patients had a mean of 2.8 + 2.2 visits to the study physician during the study period. Changes in all outcomes were similar in the "Training + Feedback" group compared to the "Feedback Only" group (PRPCC: 3.7 vs.1.8; trust: -0.7 vs. -0.2 ; satisfaction: 1.9 vs. 2.5; weight: -2.5 lbs vs. -0.7 lbs; systolic blood pressure: 1.7 mm Hg vs. 0.1 mm Hg; glycosylated hemoglobin 0.02\% vs. 0.07\%; p = NS for all).
Conclusion: The lack of measurable impact of physician training on patient-reported and diseasespecific outcomes in the current has several possible explanations, including the relatively limited nature of the intervention. We hope that the current study will help provide a basis for future studies, using more intensive interventions with different provider groups.},

	abstract = {Research on learning has primarily focused on the role of doing (experience) in fostering progress over time. Drawing on literature in cognitive psychology and neuroscience, we propose that one of the critical components of learning is reflection, or the intentional attempt to synthesize, abstract, and articulate the key lessons taught by experience. In particular, we argue that purposeful reflection on one’s accumulated experience leads to greater learning than the accumulation of additional experience. We explain this boost in learning through self-efficacy: reflection builds confidence in the ability to achieve a goal, which in turn translates into higher rates of learning. We test the resulting model experimentally, using a mixed-method design that combines two laboratory experiments with a field experiment conducted in a large businessprocess outsourcing company in India. We find that individuals who are given time to reflect on a task improve their performance at a greater rate than those who are given the same amount of time to practice with the same task. Our results also show that if individuals themselves are given the choice to either reflect or practice, they prefer to allocate their time to gaining more experience with the task– to the detriment of their learning.},

Moreover, this inconsistency eVect is speciWc to the emotion of regret, mediated by the judged quality of the decision process, independent of the valence of the decision outcomes, and, importantly, disappears when the quality of the decision process is high because inconsistency is justiWed.

On the basis of the inaction-effect bias, we theorized that negative feedback results in the tendency to take action, regardless of what that action may be. In four experiments, we demonstrated that people facing escalation-decision situations were indeed action oriented and that framing escalation as action and de-escalation as inaction resulted in a stronger tendency to escalate than framing de-escalation as action and escalation as inaction (mini-meta-analysis effect d = 0.37, 95\% confidence interval = [0.21, 0.53]).},

We identify various sources of research misbehaviour and diﬀerent categories of those aﬀected. The aim is to provide a clearer understanding of what research behaviour is deemed appropriate or not, which stakeholders it aﬀects, and the pressures and incentives likely to exacerbate such misconduct. We conclude with a discussion of how the taxonomy can help shape future good research practice (thereby setting a better example to students), and oﬀer some propositions for future research.},

	abstract = {Purpose. There is good evidence that for many behaviours, increasing risk appraisal can lead to a change in behaviour, heightened when efﬁcacy appraisals are also increased. The present systematic review addressed whether interventions presenting a risk message increase risk appraisal and an increase in vaccination intentions and uptake.
Method. A systematic search identiﬁed randomized controlled trials of interventions presenting a risk message and measuring risk appraisal and intentions and uptake postintervention. Random-effects meta-analyses investigated the size of the effect that interventions had on vaccination risk appraisal and on vaccination behaviour or intention to vaccinate, and the size of the relationship between vaccination risk appraisal and vaccination intentions and uptake.
Results. Eighteen studies were included and 16 meta-analysed. Interventions overall had small signiﬁcant effects on risk appraisal (d = 0.161, p = .047) and perceptions of susceptibility (d = 0.195, p = .025), but no effect on perceptions of severity (d = À0.036, p = .828). Interventions showed no effect on intention to vaccinate (d = 0.138, p = .195) and no effect on vaccination behaviour (d = 0.043, p = .826). Interventions typically did not include many behaviour change techniques (BCTs), with the most common BCT unique to intervention conditions being ‘Information about Health Consequences’. Few of the included studies attempted to, or successfully increased, efﬁcacy appraisals.
Conclusions. Overall, there is a lack of good-quality primary studies, and existing interventions are suboptimal. The inclusion of additional BCTs, including those to target efﬁcacy appraisals, could increase intervention effectiveness.

In an innovative approach to improve the contribution of health psychology to public health we have analysed the presence and nature of affect within the visual materials deployed in antimicrobial stewardship interventions targeting the public identiﬁed through systematic review. Design. A qualitative analysis focused on the affective content of visual materials garnered from a systematic review of antibiotic stewardship (k = 20).
Methods. A novel method was devised drawing on concepts from semiotics to analyse the affective elements within intervention materials.
Results. Whilst all studies examined tacitly rely on affect, only one sought to explicitly deploy affect. Three thematic categories of affect are identiﬁed within the materials in which speciﬁc ideological machinery is deployed: (1) monsters, bugs, and superheroes; (2) responsibility, threat, and the misuse/abuse of antibiotics; (3) the ﬁgure of the child.
Conclusions. The study demonstrates how affect is a present but tacit communication strategy of antimicrobial stewardship interventions but has not – to date – been adequately theorized or explicitly considered in the intervention design process. Certain affective features were explored in relation to the effectiveness of antimicrobial resistance interventions and warrant further investigation. We argue that further research is needed to systematically illuminate and capitalize upon the use of affect to effect behaviour change concerning antimicrobial stewardship.},

Perceptions of these qualities are often intuitive and are based on nonverbal behavior. Emphasizing both warmth and competence may prove problematic, however, because there is evidence that they are inversely related in other settings. We hypothesize that perceptions of physician competence will instead be positively correlated with perceptions of physician warmth and empathy, potentially due to changing conceptions of the physician’s role. We test this hypothesis in an analog medical context using a large online sample, manipulating physician nonverbal behaviors suggested to communicate empathy (e.g. eye contact) and competence (the physician’s white coat). Participants rated physicians displaying empathic nonverbal behavior as more empathic, warm, and more competent than physicians displaying unempathic nonverbal behavior, adjusting for mood. We found no warmth/competence tradeoff and, additionally, no significant effects of the white coat. Further, compared with male participants, female participants perceived physicians displaying unempathic nonverbal behavior as less empathic. Given the significant consequences of clinician empathy, it is important for clinicians to learn how nonverbal behavior contributes to perceptions of warmth, and use it as another tool to improve their patients’ emotional and physical health.},

Social media platforms (e.g. Facebook) and information retrieval (IR) systems (e.g. Google), are now in the public spotlight to address these issues. Our research investigates an approach, known as Nudging, applied to the domain of IR, as a potential means to minimize impacts and threats surrounding both matters. We perform our study in the space of health search for two reasons. First, encounters with misinformation in this space have potentially grave outcomes. Second, there are many potential threats to personal privacy as a result of the data collected during a search task. Adopting methods and a corpus from previous work as the foundation, our study asked users to determine the effectiveness of a treatment for 10 medical conditions. Users performed the tasks on 4 variants of a search engine results page (SERP) and a control, with 3 of the SERPS being a Nudge (re-ranking, filtering and a visual cue) intended to reduce impacts to privacy. The aim of our work is to determine the Nudge that is least impactful to good decision making while simultaneously increasing privacy protection. We find privacy impacts are reduced for all 3 approaches, however our results indicate that filtering is an approach that should be ruled out, as harmful decisions increase significantly and correct decisions decrease significantly. Our findings suggest that re-ranking is the most promising approach.},

	abstract = {Background: High consumption of antibiotics has been identified as an important driver for the increasing antibiotic resistance, considered to be one of the greatest threats to public health globally. Simply informing the public about this consequence is insufficient to induce behavioral change. This study explored beliefs and perceptions among Swedes, with the aim of identifying factors promoting and hindering a judicious approach to antibiotics use. The study focused primarily on the medical use of antibiotics, also considering other aspects connected with antibiotic resistance, such as travelling and food consumption.
Methods: Data were collected through focus group discussions at the end of 2016. Twenty-three Swedes were recruited using an area-based approach and purposive sampling, aiming for as heterogeneous groups as possible regarding gender (13 women, 10 men), age (range 20–81, mean 38), and education level. Interview transcripts were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. The Health Belief Model was used as a theoretical framework.
Results: Antibiotic resistance was identified by participants as a health threat with the potential for terrible consequences. The severity of the problem was perceived more strongly than the actual likelihood of being affected by it. Metaphors such as climate change were abundantly employed to describe antibiotic resistance as a slowly emerging problem. There was a tension between individual (egoistic) and collective (altruistic) reasons for engaging in judicious behavior. The individual effort needed and antibiotics overprescribing were considered major barriers to such behavior. In their discussions, participants stressed the need for empowerment, achieved through good health communication from authorities and family physicians.
Conclusions: Knowledge about antibiotic consumption and resistance, as well as values such as altruism and trust in the health care system, has significant influence on both perceptions of individual responsibility and on behavior. This suggests that these factors should be emphasized in health education and health promotion. To instead frame antibiotic resistance as a slowly emerging disaster, risks diminish the public perception of being susceptible to it.},

	abstract = {Background. The identification and reduction of medical error has become a major priority for all health care providers, including primary care. Understanding the frequency and nature of medical error in primary care is a first step in developing a policy to reduce harm and improve patient safety. There has been scant research into this area.
Objectives. This review had two objectives; first, to identify the frequency and nature of error in primary care, and, secondly, to consider the possible causes for the diversity in the stated rates and nature of error in primary care.
Methods. Literature searches of English language studies identified in the National Patient Safety Foundation bibliography database, in Medline and in Embase were carried out. Studies that were relevant to the purpose of the study were included. Additional information was obtained from a specialist medico-legal database.
Results. Studies identified that medical error occurs between five and 80 times per 100 000 consultations, mainly related to the processes involved in diagnosis and treatment. Prescribing and prescription errors have been identified to occur in up to 11\% of all prescriptions, mainly related to errors in dose. There are a wide variety of definitions and methods used to identify the frequency and nature of medical error. Incident reporting, systematic identification and medico-legal databases reveal differing aspects, and there are additional perspectives obtained from GPs, primary health care workers and patients.
Conclusion. An understanding of the true frequency and nature of medical error is complicated by the different definitions and methods used in the studies. Further research is warranted to understand the complex nature and causes of such errors that occur in primary care so that appropriate policy decisions to improve patient safety can be made.},

Design Qualitative study based on in-depth interviews. Setting Outpatient oncology clinics at a London cancer centre. Participants 17 patients with cancer diagnosed in previous 6 months. Main outcome measures Analysis of patients’ narratives to identify key themes and categories.
Results While all patients wanted basic information on diagnosis and treatment, not all wanted further information at all stages of their illness. Three overarching attitudes to their management of cancer limited patients’ desire for and subsequent efforts to obtain further information: faith, hope, and charity. Faith in their doctor’s medical expertise precluded the need for patients to seek further information themselves. Hope was essential for patients to carry on with life as normal and could be maintained through silence and avoiding information, especially too detailed or “unsafe” information. Charity to fellow patients, especially those seen as more needy than themselves, was expressed in the recognition that scarce resources—including information and explanations—had to be shared and meant that limited information was accepted as inevitable.
Conclusions Cancer patients’ attitudes to cancer and their strategies for coping with their illness can constrain their wish for information and their efforts to obtain it. In developing recommendations, the government’s cancer information strategy should attend to variations in patients’ desires for information and the reasons for them.},

	abstract = {Many studies find that presentation of balanced information, offering competing positions, can promote polarization and thus increase preexisting social divisions. We offer two explanations for this apparently puzzling phenomenon. The first involves what we call asymmetric Bayesianism: the same information can have diametrically opposite effects if those who receive it have opposing antecedent convictions. Recipients whose beliefs are buttressed by the message, or a relevant part, rationally believe that it is true, while recipients whose beliefs are at odds with that message, or a relevant part, rationally believe that the message is false (and may reflect desperation). The second explanation is that the same information can activate radically different memories and associated convictions, thus producing polarized responses to that information, or what we call a memory boomerang. An understanding of these explanations reveals when balanced news will produce unbalanced views. The explanations also account for the potential influence of “surprising validators.” Because such validators are credible to the relevant audience, they can reduce the likelihood of asymmetric Bayesianism, thus promoting agreement.},

	abstract = {Background: A global antimicrobial resistance (AMR) awareness intervention targeting the general public has been prioritized.
Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions that aim to change AMR awareness and subsequent stewardship behaviours amongst the public.
Methods: Five databases were searched between 2000 and 2016 for interventions to change the public’s AMR awareness and/or antimicrobial stewardship behaviours. Study designs meeting the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of Care (EPOC) criteria, non-controlled before-and-after studies and prospective cohort studies were considered eligible. Participants recruited from healthcare settings and studies measuring stewardship behaviours of healthcare professionals were excluded. Quality of studies was assessed using EPOC risk of bias criteria. Data were extracted and synthesized narratively. Registration: PROSPERO international prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO 2016: CRD42016050343).
Results: Twenty studies were included in the review with nine meeting the EPOC criteria. The overall risk of bias was high. Nineteen studies were conducted in high-income countries. Mass media interventions were most common (n " 7), followed by school-based (n " 6) and printed material interventions (n " 6). Seventeen studies demonstrated a signiﬁcant effect on changing knowledge, attitudes or the public’s antimicrobial stewardship behaviours. Analysis showed that interventions targeting schoolchildren and parents have notable potential, but for the general public the picture is less clear.
Conclusions: Our work provides an in-depth examination of the effectiveness of AMR interventions for the public. However, the studies were heterogeneous and the quality of evidence was poor. Well-designed, experimental studies on behavioural outcomes of such interventions are required.},

	doi = {10.1378/chest.128.3.1497},
	abstract = {Background: Pulmonary and critical care physicians routinely make complex decisions, but little is known about cognitive aspects of this process. Omission bias and status quo bias are well-descibed cognitive biases that can cause lay decision makers to prefer inaction that preserves the status quo even when changing the status quo through action is more likely to lead to the best outcomes. It is unknown if these biases influence trained decision makers such as pulmonologists. Study objectives: To determine whether omission bias and status quo bias influence the medical decisions of pulmonologists. Design and interventions: The study was a randomized controlled trial conducted within a cross-sectional survey of pulmonologists’ opinions about the relevance of various factors in pulmonary and critical care decision making. We designed case vignettes that presented patient information with an associated patient management choice. The status quo state and the action/omission distinction were varied in two forms of otherwise identical vignettes. One form of each case vignette pair (A and B) was administered randomly to each prospective respondent during the first mailing of the opinion survey. Participants: Five hundred pulmonologists selected randomly from the membership of the American College of Chest Physicians.
Measurements and results: There were 125 respondents, including 59 for form A and 66 form B (enrollment rate, 25\%). In vignettes involving evaluation of pulmonary embolism and treatment of septic shock, respondents were more likely to choose a suboptimal management strategy when an omission option was present that allowed preservation of the status quo (71\% vs 53\%, p ؍ 0.048; 50\% vs 29\%, p ؍ 0.016, respectively). In a vignette involving a hypothetical clinical trial and the decision to prescribe tube feeding, the omission option was not significantly associated with the decision to prescribe tube feeding (54\% vs 50\%, p ؍ 0.67).
Conclusion: Pulmonary and critical care decisions are susceptible to the influence of omission and status quo bias. Because of the great number of decisions that are made each day involving choices between maintaining or changing the status quo, this finding could have far-reaching implications for patient outcomes, cost-effectiveness, resource utilization, clinical practice variability, and medical errors.},

	abstract = {Websites opposing vaccination are prevalent on the Internet. Web 2.0, deﬁned by interaction and usergenerated content, has become ubiquitous. Furthermore, a new postmodern paradigm of healthcare has emerged, where power has shifted from doctors to patients, the legitimacy of science is questioned, and expertise is redeﬁned. Together this has created an environment where anti-vaccine activists are able to effectively spread their messages. Evidence shows that individuals turn to the Internet for vaccination advice, and suggests such sources can impact vaccination decisions – therefore it is likely that antivaccine websites can inﬂuence whether people vaccinate themselves or their children. This overview examines the types of rhetoric individuals may encounter online in order to better understand why the anti-vaccination movement can be convincing, despite lacking scientiﬁc support for their claims. Tactics and tropes commonly used to argue against vaccination are described. This includes actions such as skewing science, shifting hypotheses, censoring dissent, and attacking critics; also discussed are frequently made claims such as not being “anti-vaccine” but “pro-safe vaccines”, that vaccines are toxic or unnatural, and more. Recognizing disingenuous claims made by the anti-vaccination movement is essential in order to critically evaluate the information and misinformation encountered online.},

	abstract = {Objectives: Social prescribing is a way of linking patients in primary care with sources of support within the community to help improve their health and wellbeing. Social prescribing programmes are being widely promoted and adopted in the UK National Health Service and so we conducted a systematic review to assess the evidence for their effectiveness. Setting/data sources: Nine databases were searched from 2000 to January 2016 for studies conducted in the UK. Relevant reports and guidelines, websites and reference lists of retrieved articles were scanned to identify additional studies. All the searches were restricted to English language only. Participants: Systematic reviews and any published evaluation of programmes where patient referral was made from a primary care setting to a link worker or facilitator of social prescribing were eligible for inclusion. Risk of bias for included studies was undertaken independently by two reviewers and a narrative synthesis was performed. Primary and secondary outcome measures: Primary outcomes of interest were any measures of health and well-being and/or usage of health services.
Results: We included a total of 15 evaluations of social prescribing programmes. Most were small scale and limited by poor design and reporting. All were rated as a having a high risk of bias. Common design issues included a lack of comparative controls, short follow-up durations, a lack of standardised and validated measuring tools, missing data and a failure to consider potential confounding factors. Despite clear methodological shortcomings, most evaluations presented positive conclusions.
Conclusions: Social prescribing is being widely advocated and implemented but current evidence fails to provide sufficient detail to judge either success or value for money. If social prescribing is to realise its potential, future evaluations must be comparative by design and consider when, by whom, for whom, how well and at what cost.

	abstract = {This paper addresses: 1) Situations where human behaviour is involved in relation to antibiotics, focusing on providers and consumers; 2) Theories about human behaviour and factors inﬂuencing behaviour in relation to antibiotics; 3) How behaviour in relation to antibiotics can change; and, 4) Antibiotic mainstreaming as an approach to facilitate changes in human behaviour as regards antibiotics. Inﬂuencing human behaviour in relation to antibiotics is a complex process which includes factors like knowledge, attitudes, social norms, socio-economic conditions, peer pressure, experiences, and bio-physical and sociobehavioural environment. Further, key concepts are often perceived in different ways by different individuals. While designing and implementing projects or programmes for behavioural change with respect to antibiotics for professionals or consumers it is helpful to consider theories or models of behaviour change, e.g. the ‘stages of change model’, including pre-contemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance. People in different stages of change are susceptible to different behaviour modiﬁcation strategies. Application of marketing principles to ‘global good’, so-called ‘social marketing’, to improve ‘welfare of the individual and society’ is gaining increased attention in public health. In conclusion, just providing correct knowledge is not sufﬁcient although it is a pre-requisite for behaviour modiﬁcation in the desired direction. We can never change the behaviour of any other human, but we can facilitate for others to change their own behaviour. One possibility is to implement ‘antibiotic mainstreaming’ as a potentially effective way for behaviour modiﬁcation, i.e. to address consequences for maintaining effective antibiotics in all activities and decisions in society.},

	abstract = {Background. Signal detection theory (SDT) describes how respondents categorize ambiguous stimuli over repeated trials. It measures separately ‘‘discrimination’’ (ability to recognize a signal amid noise) and ‘‘criterion’’ (inclination to respond ‘‘signal’’ v. ‘‘noise’’). This is important because respondents may produce the same accuracy rate for different reasons. We employed SDT to measure the referral decision making of general practitioners (GPs) in cases of possible lung cancer. Methods. We constructed 44 vignettes of patients for whom lung cancer could be considered and estimated their 1-year risk. Under UK risk-based guidelines, half of the vignettes required urgent referral. We recruited 216 GPs from practices across England. Practices differed in the positive predictive value (PPV) of their urgent referrals (chance of referrals identifying cancer) and the sensitivity (chance of cancer patients being picked up via urgent referral from their practice). Participants saw the vignettes online and indicated whether they would refer each patient urgently or not. We calculated each GP’s discrimination (d 0) and criterion (c) and regressed these on practice PPV and sensitivity, as well as on GP experience and gender. Results. Criterion was associated with practice PPV: as PPV increased, GPs’c also increased, indicating lower inclination to refer (b = 0.06 [0.02–0.09]; P = 0.001). Female GPs were more inclined to refer than male GPs (b = 20.20 [20.40 to 20.001]; P = 0.049). Average discrimination was modest (d 0 = 0.77), highly variable (range, 20.28 to 1.91), and not associated with practice referral performance. Conclusions. High referral PPV at the organizational level indicates GPs’ inclination to avoid false positives, not better discrimination. Rather than bluntly mandating increases in practice PPV via more referrals, it is necessary to increase discrimination by improving the evidence base for cancer referral decisions.},

Effect sizes were reported for fewer than half of the analyses; no article reported a confidence interval for an effect size.

Partial ␩2 was the most commonly reported effect size estimate for analysis of variance.

Based upon ﬁndings from the management of other sustainability and collective action dilemmas, we hypothesize that interpersonal trust is crucial for people’s propensity to cooperate for the common objective. The aim of this article is to further our understanding of people’s antibiotic consumption by investigating if individuals’ willingness to voluntarily abstain from antibiotic use is linked to interpersonal trust. To fulﬁll the aim, we implement two empirical investigations. In the ﬁrst part, we use cross-section survey data to investigate the link between interpersonal trust and willingness to abstain from using antibiotics. The second part is based on a survey experiment in which we study the indirect effect of trust on willingness to abstain from using antibiotics by experimentally manipulating the proclaimed trustworthiness of other people to abstain from antibiotics. We ﬁnd that interpersonal trust is linked to abstemiousness, also when controlling for potential confounders. The survey experiment demonstrates that trustworthiness stimulates individuals to abstain from using antibiotics. In conclusion, trust is an important asset for preserving effective antibiotics for future generations, as well as for reaching many of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals.},

This article aims to provide a practical primer on how to calculate and report effect sizes for t-tests and ANOVA’s such that effect sizes can be used in a-priori power analyses and meta-analyses. Whereas many articles about effect sizes focus on between-subjects designs and address within-subjects designs only brieﬂy, I provide a detailed overview of the similarities and differences between withinand between-subjects designs. I suggest that some research questions in experimental psychology examine inherently intra-individual effects, which makes effect sizes that incorporate the correlation between measures the best summary of the results.

Objective.  To achieve a deeper understanding of parents’ acceptance, or otherwise, of clinicians’ antibiotic prescribing decisions for children with RTIs.
Methods.  Qualitative interviews with parents of child patients who had recently consulted in primary care with a RTI in four European countries, with a five-stage analytic framework approach (familiarization, developing a thematic framework from interview questions and emerging themes, indexing, charting and interpretation).
Results.  Fifty of 63 parents accepted clinicians’ management decisions, irrespective of antibiotic prescription. There were no notable differences between networks. Parents ascribed their acceptance to a trusting and open clinician–patient relationship, enhanced through continuity of care, in which parents felt able to express their views. There was a lack of congruence about antibiotics between parents and clinicians in 13 instances, mostly when parents disagreed about clinicians’ decision to prescribe (10 accounts) rather than objecting to withholding antibiotics (three accounts). All but one parent adhered to the prescribing decision, although some modified how the antibiotic was administered.
Conclusions.  Parents from contrasting countries indicated that continuity of care, open communication in consultations and clinician–patient trust was important in acceptance of management of RTI in their children and in motivating adherence. Interventions to promote appropriate},

Studies that were included were randomised controlled trials, controlled before and after studies, cohort studies and economic evaluations. Many studies demonstrated that the use of CRP tests in patients presenting with RTI symptoms reduces antibiotic prescribing by 23.3\% to 36.16\%. Procalcitonin is not currently available as a point-of-care testing (POCT), but has shown value for patients with RTI admitted to hospital. GPs and patients report a good acceptability for a CRP POCT and economic evaluations show cost-effectiveness of CRP POCT over existing RTI management in primary care. POCTs increase diagnostic precision for GPs in the better management of patients with RTI. CRP POCT can better target antibacterial prescribing by GPs and contribute to national antimicrobial resistance strategies. Health services need to develop ways to ensure funding is transferred in order for POCT to be implemented.},

Two studies were conducted, one that involved a nationally representative U.S. sample and another that involved an online convenience sample. All participants were asked whether they would want to receive a hypothetical screening test for breast (women) or prostate (men) cancer that does not reduce the chance of cancer death or extend the length of life. Over half of participants wanted to receive the described screening test. Many people did not believe that cancer screening might not save lives, yet screening preferences were not due to disbelief alone. Results further suggested that cancer worry, reassurance, and a desire for health information explained variance in preferences for unbeneficial screening, adjusting for beliefs about screening benefits, perceptions of screening risks, family history, perceptions of cancer risk, and demographics.},

Subjects either judged the morality of actors by their choices or rated the goodness of decision options. Subjects often rated harmful omissions as less immoral, or less bad as decisions, than harmful commissions. Such ratings were associated with judgments that omissions do not cause outcomes. The eﬀect of commission is not simply an exaggerated response to commissions: a reverse eﬀect for good outcomes was not found, and a few subjects were even willing to accept greater harm in order to avoid action. The ‘omission bias’ revealed in these experiments can be described as an overgeneralization of a useful heuristic to cases in which it is not justiﬁed. Additional experiments indicated that that subjects’ judgments about the immorality of omissions and commissions are dependent on several factors that ordinarily distinguish omissions and commissions: physical movement in commissions, the presence of salient alternative causes in omissions, and the fact that the consequences of omissions would occur if the actor were absent or ignorant of the eﬀects of not acting.},

	abstract = {Most theories of motivation and behavior (and lay intuitions alike) consider pain and effort to be deterrents. In contrast to this widely held view, we provide evidence that the prospect of enduring pain and exerting effort for a prosocial cause can promote contributions to the cause. Speciﬁcally, we show that willingness to contribute to a charitable or collective cause increases when the contribution process is expected to be painful and effortful rather than easy and enjoyable. Across ﬁve experiments, we document this “martyrdom effect,” show that the observed patterns defy standard economic and psychological accounts, and identify a mediator and moderator of the effect. Experiment 1 showed that people are willing to donate more to charity when they anticipate having to suffer to raise money. Experiment 2 extended these ﬁndings to a non-charity laboratory context that involved real money and actual pain. Experiment 3 demonstrated that the martyrdom effect is not the result of an attribute substitution strategy (whereby people use the amount of pain and effort involved in fundraising to determine donation worthiness). Experiment 4 showed that perceptions of meaningfulness partially mediate the martyrdom effect. Finally, Experiment 5 demonstrated that the nature of the prosocial cause moderates the martyrdom effect: the effect is strongest for causes associated with human suffering. We propose that anticipated pain and effort lead people to ascribe greater meaning to their contributions and to the experience of contributing, thereby motivating higher prosocial contributions. We conclude by considering some implications of this puzzling phenomenon. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Healthcare workers (HCWs) are an important priority group for vaccination against inﬂuenza, yet, ﬂu vaccine uptake remains low among them. Psychosocial studies of HCWs’ decisions to get vaccinated have commonly drawn on subjective expected utility models to assess predictors of vaccination, assuming HCWs’ choices result from a rational information-weighing process. By contrast, we recast those decisions as a commitment to vaccination and we aimed to understand why HCWs may want to (rather than believe they need to) get vaccinated against the ﬂu. This article outlines the development and validation of a 9-item measure of cognitive empowerment towards ﬂu vaccination (MoVac-ﬂu scale) and an 11-item measure of cognitive empowerment towards vaccination advocacy. Both scales were administered to 784 frontline NHS HCWs with direct patient contact between June 2014 and July 2015. The scales exhibited excellent reliability and a clear unidimensional factor structure. An examination of the nomological network of the cognitive empowerment construct in relation to HCWs’ vaccination against the ﬂu revealed that this construct was distinct from traditional measures of risk perception and the strongest predictor of HCWs’ decisions to vaccinate. Similarly, cognitive empowerment in relation to vaccination advocacy was a strong predictor of HCWs’ engagement with vaccination advocacy. These ﬁndings suggest that the cognitive empowerment construct has important implications for advancing our understanding of HCWs’ decisions to vaccinate as well as their advocacy behavior.},

	abstract = {Background: Health risk calculators are widely available on the Internet, including cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk calculators that estimate the probability of a heart attack, stroke, or death over a 5- or 10-year period. Some calculators convert this probability to “heart age”, where a heart age older than current age indicates modifiable risk factors. These calculators may impact patient decision making about CVD risk management with or without clinician involvement, but little is known about how patients use them. Previous studies have not investigated patient understanding of heart age compared to 5-year percentage risk, or the best way to present heart age.
Objective: This study aimed to investigate patient experiences and understanding of online heart age calculators that use different verbal, numerical, and graphical formats, based on 5- and 10-year Framingham risk equations used in clinical practice guidelines around the world.
Methods: General practitioners in New South Wales, Australia, recruited 26 patients with CVD/lifestyle risk factors who were not taking cholesterol or blood pressure-lowering medication in 2012. Participants were asked to “think aloud” while using two heart age calculators in random order, with semi-structured interviews before and after. Transcribed audio recordings were coded and a framework analysis method was used.
Results: Risk factor questions were often misinterpreted, reducing the accuracy of the calculators. Participants perceived older heart age as confronting and younger heart age as positive but unrealistic. Unexpected or contradictory results (eg, low percentage risk but older heart age) led participants to question the credibility of the calculators. Reasons to discredit the results included the absence of relevant lifestyle questions and impact of corporate sponsorship. However, the calculators prompted participants to consider lifestyle changes irrespective of whether they received younger, same, or older heart age results.
Conclusions: Online heart age calculators can be misunderstood and disregarded if they produce unexpected or contradictory results, but they may still motivate lifestyle changes. Future research should investigate both the benefits and harms of communicating risk in this way, and how to increase the reliability and credibility of online health risk calculators.},

Methods—690 women participated in an online program to learn about medications that can reduce the risk of breast cancer. The program presented tailored information about each woman’s personal breast cancer risk. Half of women were told how their risk numbers were calculated, whereas the rest were not. Later, they were asked whether they believed that the program was personalized, and whether they believed their risk numbers. If a woman did not believe her risk numbers, she was asked to explain why.
Results—Beliefs that the program was personalized were enhanced by explaining the risk calculation methods in more detail. Nonetheless, nearly 20\% of women did not believe their personalized risk numbers. The most common reason for rejecting the risk estimate was a belief that it did not fully account for personal and family history.
Conclusions—The benefits of tailored risk statistics may be attenuated by a tendency for people to be skeptical that these risk estimates apply to them personally.},

	abstract = {Objective: Cancer causes death to millions of people worldwide. Early detection of cancer in primary care may enhance patients’ chances of survival. Physicians, however, often miss early cancers, which tend to present with undifferentiated symptoms. Within a theoretical framework of the hypothesis generation model (HyGene), and psychological literature, we studied how two factors – cancer prevalence and an alternative explanation for the patient’s symptoms – impede early cancer detection, as well as prompt patient management. Methods: Three hundred family physicians diagnosed and managed two patient cases, where cancer was a possible diagnosis (one colorectal, the other lung cancer). We employed a 2 (cancer prevalence: low vs. high) × 2 (alternative explanation: present vs. absent) between-subjects design. Cancer prevalence was manipulated by changing either patient age or sex; the alternative explanation for the symptoms was manipulated by adding or removing a relevant clinical history. Each patient consulted twice. Results: In a series of random-intercept logistic models, both higher prevalence (OR 1.92, 95\% CI [1.27, 2.92]) and absence of an alternative explanation (OR 1.70, 95\% CI[1.11, 2.59]) increased the likelihood of a cancer diagnosis which, in turn, increased the likelihood of prompt referral (OR 22.84, 95\% CI[16.14, 32.32]). Conclusions: These findings confirm the probabilistic nature of the diagnosis generation process and validate the application of the hypothesis generation model to early cancer detection. Increasing the salience of cancer – such as listing cancer as a diagnostic possibility – during the initial hypothesis generation phase may improve early cancer detection.},

	abstract = {A striking ﬁnding has emerged recently in the literature: When decision makers are faced with essentially the same choice, their preferences differ as a function of whether options are described or are ‘‘experienced’’ via observation and feedback. For example, when presented the described choice: (A) A 90\% chance of \$0 and a 10\% chance of \$10 or (B) \$1 for sure, people tend to prefer (A). But when those same two options are experienced through observation of ‘‘draws’’ from two payoff distributions that match the described options, the modal preference reverses. Why? This is just one question that the papers in this special issue address. In addition, they address the rich repertoire of issues that arise when one considers experience-based choices. The decisions-fromexperience paradigm—with its focus on the acquisition and integration of information prior to choice, as well the choice itself—taps many of the fundamentals of psychology (learning, memory, encoding, knowledge representation, modelling) thus inspiring novel and fruitful avenues for research. This paper reviews recent research on experience-based choice, and highlights the contribution of the papers in the special issue. The paper introduces a framework that places different types of decisions along a continuum of uncertainty about what one is choosing between, which emphasizes the rich and varied role of ‘‘experience’’ in decision making. It ends by identifying important unsolved questions that are ripe for future research. Copyright \# 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

However, when payoﬀs are learned from repeated experience of outcomes (as in many real-world decisions), diﬀerent patterns of choice are observed—consistent with underweighting rare events. We re-examined this phenomenon to determine whether biased sampling and recency eﬀects in experience-based choice could account for this description–experience gap. Two hundred and forty paid participants made choices for 12 pairs of simple gambles. In the objective description condition, probabilities and outcomes were speciﬁed. In the free sampling condition, participants observed repeated plays of each gamble before choosing. Participants in four yoked conditions received the same information as the free sampling participants—either described or experienced. Diﬀerences between objective description and free sampling were consistent with underweighting rare events in experience-based choice. However, consistent with a biased sampling account, patterns of choice in the yoked conditions barely diﬀered from the free sampling condition: given identical information, presentation mode has no eﬀect. Recency eﬀects in choice occurred only when outcomes were actively sampled, and were unaﬀected by working memory capacity. The absence of recency for passive observation implies actor–observer diﬀerences in forming expectations or testing hypotheses. The results provide no support for the claim that decisions from description and decisions from experience require separate descriptive theories.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND. Substantial research links many of the defining characteristics of primary care to important out­ comes; yet little is known about the relative importance of each characteristic, and several characteristics have not been examined. These analyses evaluate the relationship between seven defining elements of primary care (accessibility, continuity, comprehensiveness, integration, clinical interaction, interpersonal treatment, and trust) and three outcomes (adherence to physician’s advice, patient satisfaction, and improved health status).
METHODS. Data were derived from a cross-sectional observational study of adults employed by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (N=7204). All patients completed a validated questionnaire, the Primary Care Assessment Survey. Regression methods were used to examine the association between each primary care char­ acteristic (11 summary scales measuring 7 elements of care) and each outcome.
RESULTS. Physicians’ comprehensive (“whole person”) knowledge of patients and patients’ trust in their physi­ cian were the variables most strongly associated with adherence, and trust was the variable most strongly asso­ ciated with patients’ satisfaction with their physician. With other factors equal, adherence rates were 2.6 times higher among patients with whole-person knowledge scores in the 95th percentile compared with the 5th per­ centile (44.0\% adherence vs 16.8\% adherence, P {\textless}.001). The likelihood of complete satisfaction was 87.5\% for those with 95th percentile trust scores compared with 0.4\% for patients with 5th percentile trust scores (P {\textless}.001). The leading correlates of self-reported health improvements were integration of care, thoroughness of physical examinations, communication, comprehensive knowledge of patients, and trust (P {\textless}.001).
CONCLUSIONS. Patients’ trust in their physician and physicians’ knowledge of patients are leading correlates of three important outcomes of care. The results are noteworthy in the context of pervasive changes in our nation’s health care system that are widely viewed as threatening to the quality of physician-patient relationships.},

	abstract = {Background: Cognitive biases and personality traits (aversion to risk or ambiguity) may lead to diagnostic inaccuracies and medical errors resulting in mismanagement or inadequate utilization of resources. We conducted a systematic review with four objectives: 1) to identify the most common cognitive biases, 2) to evaluate the influence of cognitive biases on diagnostic accuracy or management errors, 3) to determine their impact on patient outcomes, and 4) to identify literature gaps.
Methods: We searched MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library databases for relevant articles on cognitive biases from 1980 to May 2015. We included studies conducted in physicians that evaluated at least one cognitive factor using case-vignettes or real scenarios and reported an associated outcome written in English. Data quality was assessed by the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Among 114 publications, 20 studies comprising 6810 physicians met the inclusion criteria. Nineteen cognitive biases were identified.
Results: All studies found at least one cognitive bias or personality trait to affect physicians. Overconfidence, lower tolerance to risk, the anchoring effect, and information and availability biases were associated with diagnostic inaccuracies in 36.5 to 77 \% of case-scenarios. Five out of seven (71.4 \%) studies showed an association between cognitive biases and therapeutic or management errors. Of two (10 \%) studies evaluating the impact of cognitive biases or personality traits on patient outcomes, only one showed that higher tolerance to ambiguity was associated with increased medical complications (9.7 \% vs 6.5 \%; p = .004). Most studies (60 \%) targeted cognitive biases in diagnostic tasks, fewer focused on treatment or management (35 \%) and on prognosis (10 \%). Literature gaps include potentially relevant biases (e.g. aggregate bias, feedback sanction, hindsight bias) not investigated in the included studies. Moreover, only five (25 \%) studies used clinical guidelines as the framework to determine diagnostic or treatment errors. Most studies (n = 12, 60 \%) were classified as low quality.
Conclusions: Overconfidence, the anchoring effect, information and availability bias, and tolerance to risk may be associated with diagnostic inaccuracies or suboptimal management. More comprehensive studies are needed to determine the prevalence of cognitive biases and personality traits and their potential impact on physicians’ decisions, medical errors, and patient outcomes.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE To assess effects of behavioral interventions and rates of inappropriate (not guideline-concordant) antibiotic prescribing during ambulatory visits for acute respiratory tract infections. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Cluster randomized clinical trial conducted among 47 primary care practices in Boston and Los Angeles. Participants were 248 enrolled clinicians randomized to receive 0, 1, 2, or 3 interventions for 18 months. All clinicians received education on antibiotic prescribing guidelines on enrollment. Interventions began between November 1, 2011, and October 1, 2012. Follow-up for the latest-starting sites ended on April 1, 2014. Adult patients with comorbidities and concomitant infections were excluded. INTERVENTIONS Three behavioral interventions, implemented alone or in combination: suggested alternatives presented electronic order sets suggesting nonantibiotic treatments; accountable justification prompted clinicians to enter free-text justifications for prescribing antibiotics into patients’ electronic health records; peer comparison sent emails to clinicians that compared their antibiotic prescribing rates with those of “top performers” (those with the lowest inappropriate prescribing rates). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Antibiotic prescribing rates for visits with antibiotic-inappropriate diagnoses (nonspecific upper respiratory tract infections, acute bronchitis, and influenza) from 18 months preintervention to 18 months afterward, adjusting each intervention’s effects for co-occurring interventions and preintervention trends, with random effects for practices and clinicians.
RESULTS There were 14 753 visits (mean patient age, 47 years; 69\% women) for antibiotic-inappropriate acute respiratory tract infections during the baseline period and 16 959 visits (mean patient age, 48 years; 67\% women) during the intervention period. Mean antibiotic prescribing rates decreased from 24.1\% at intervention start to 13.1\% at intervention month 18 (absolute difference, −11.0\%) for control practices; from 22.1\% to 6.1\% (absolute difference, −16.0\%) for suggested alternatives (difference in differences, −5.0\% [95\% CI, −7.8\% to 0.1\%]; P = .66 for differences in trajectories); from 23.2\% to 5.2\% (absolute difference, −18.1\%) for accountable justification (difference in differences, −7.0\% [95\% CI, −9.1\% to −2.9\%]; P {\textless} .001); and from 19.9\% to 3.7\% (absolute difference, −16.3\%) for peer comparison (difference in differences, −5.2\% [95\% CI, −6.9\% to −1.6\%]; P {\textless} .001). There were no statistically significant interactions (neither synergy nor interference) between interventions.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among primary care practices, the use of accountable justification and peer comparison as behavioral interventions resulted in lower rates of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for acute respiratory tract infections.},

	abstract = {Privacy concerns are becoming a dominant focus in search applications, thus there is a growing need to understand implications of efforts to address these concerns. Our research investigates a search system with privacy warning labels, an approach inspired by decision making research on food nutrition labels. This approach is designed to alert users to potential privacy threats in their search for information as one possible avenue to address privacy concerns. Our primary goal was to understand the extent to which attitudes towards privacy are linked to behaviors that protect privacy. In the present study participants were given a set of fact based decision tasks from the domain of health search. Participants were rotated through variations of search engine results pages (SERPs) of which they encountered a SERP with a privacy warning light system and completed a survey which captured attitudes towards privacy, behaviors to protect privacy, and other demographic information. In addition to the comparison of interactive search behaviors of a privacy warning SERP with a control SERP, we compared self reported privacy measures with interactive search behaviors. Participants reported strong concerns around privacy of health information while simultaneously placing high importance on the correctness of this information. Analysis of our interactive experiment and self report privacy measures indicate that 1) choice of privacy protective browsers has a significant link to privacy attitudes and privacy protective behaviors in a SERP and 2) there are no significant links between reported concerns towards privacy and recorded behavior in an information retrieval system with warnings that enable users to protect their privacy.},

	abstract = {Background: A critical factor shaping parental attitudes to vaccination is the parent’s interactions with health professionals. An effective interaction can address the concerns of vaccine supportive parents and motivate a hesitant parent towards vaccine acceptance. Poor communication can contribute to rejection of vaccinations or dissatisfaction with care. We sought to provide a framework for health professionals when communicating with parents about vaccination.
Methods: Literature review to identify a spectrum of parent attitudes or ‘positions’ on childhood vaccination with estimates of the proportion of each group based on population studies. Development of a framework related to each parental position with determination of key indicators, goals and strategies based on communication science, motivational interviewing and valid consent principles.
Results: Five distinct parental groups were identified: the ‘unquestioning acceptor’ (30–40\%), the ‘cautious acceptor’ (25–35\%); the ‘hesitant’ (20–30\%); the ‘late or selective vaccinator’ (2–27\%); and the ‘refuser’ of all vaccines ({\textless}2\%). The goals of the encounter with each group will vary, depending on the parents’ readiness to vaccinate. In all encounters, health professionals should build rapport, accept questions and concerns, and facilitate valid consent. For the hesitant, late or selective vaccinators, or refusers, strategies should include use of a guiding style and eliciting the parent’s own motivations to vaccinate while, avoiding excessive persuasion and adversarial debates. It may be necessary to book another appointment or offer attendance at a specialised adverse events clinic. Good information resources should also be used.
Conclusions: Health professionals have a central role in maintaining public trust in vaccination, including addressing parents’ concerns. These recommendations are tailored to specific parental positions on vaccination and provide a structured approach to assist professionals. They advocate respectful interactions that aim to guide parents towards quality decisions.},

	abstract = {Objective: Medical over- and underutilization are central problems that stand in the way of delivering optimal health care. As a result, one important question is how people decide to take action, versus not, when it comes to their health. The present article proposes and validates a new measure that captures the extent to which individuals are “medical maximizers” who are predisposed to seek health care even for minor problems, versus “medical minimizers” who prefer to avoid medical intervention unless it is necessary. Method: Studies 1–3 recruited participants using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. Study 1 conducted exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to identify items relevant to the proposed construct. In Study 2 confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted on the identified items, as well as tests of internal, discriminant, and convergent validity. Study 3 examined test–retest reliability of the scale. Study 4 validated the scale in a non-Internet sample. Results: EFA identified 10 items consistent with the proposed construct, and subsequent CFA showed that the 10 items were best understood with a bifactor model that assessed a single underlying construct consistent with medical maximizing–minimizing, with 3 of the 10 items cross-loading on another independent factor. The scale was distinct from hypochondriasis, distrust in medicine, health care access, and health status, and predicted self-reported health care utilization and a variety of treatment preferences. Conclusions: Individuals have general preferences to maximize versus minimize their use of health care, and these preferences are predictive of health care utilization and treatment preferences across a range of health care contexts.},

Objectives. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical predictors of GPs’ prescribing of antibiotics.
Methods. We used Clinical Judgment Analysis to study the responses of GPs to hypothetical paper-based vignettes of a 20-year-old with a respiratory tract infection. The nature of four symptoms and signs (colour of nasal mucous discharge; soreness of the throat; presence of fever; and whether any cough was productive of sputum) was varied and their effect on prescribing measured using logistic regression.
Results. Twenty GPs participated. The nature of each symptom and sign significantly predicted prescribing of an antibiotic. Cough productive of yellow sputum; presence of sore throat; fever; and coloured nasal mucus increased the probability of an antibiotic being prescribed.
Conclusions. GPs are influenced by clinical signs and symptoms to use antibiotics for respiratory infections for which there is poor evidence of efficacy from the literature.},

	abstract = {Background Concerns about adverse effects on patient satisfaction may be an important obstacle to attempts to curtail antibiotic prescribing. Aim To determine the relationship between antibiotic prescribing in general practice and reported patient satisfaction. Design and setting Retrospective cross-sectional study of general practices in England.
Method Data were obtained from the General Practice Patient Survey (GPPS) in 2012 (2.7 million questionnaires in England; 982 999 responses; response rate 36\%); the national Quality and Outcomes Framework dataset for England, 2011–2012 (8164 general practices); and general practice and demographic characteristics. Standardised measures of antibiotic prescribing volumes were obtained for each practice in England during 2012–2013, together with 12 other nationally available prescribing variables. The role of antibiotic prescribing volume was identified as a determinant of GPPS scores and adjusted for demographic and practice factors using multiple linear regression.
Results The final dataset consisted of 7800 (95.5\%) practices. A total of 33.7 million antibiotic prescriptions were issued to a registered population of 53.8 million patients. Antibiotic prescribing volume was a significant positive predictor of all ‘doctor satisfaction’ and ‘practice satisfaction’ scores in the GPPS, and was the strongest predictor of overall satisfaction out of 13 prescribing variables. A theoretical 25\% reduction in antibiotic prescribing volume would be associated with 0.5–1.0\% lower patient satisfaction scores, a drop of 3–6 centile points in national satisfaction ranking.
Conclusion Patients were less satisfied in practices with frugal antibiotic prescribing. A cautious approach to antibiotic prescribing may require a trade-off in terms of patient satisfaction.},

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Two hundred seventythree (70\%) of the respondents reported that antibiotics were beneficial for bacterial respiratory illnesses, 211 (55\%) reported that antibiotics were beneficial for viral respiratory illnesses, and 82 (21\%) reported that antibiotics were beneficial for bacterial but not for viral illness. Multivariate regression analysis identified consulting an advice nurse (odds ratio [OR] 2.9; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.7, 5.3), ever being told by a provider that antibiotics were not needed for a respiratory illness episode (OR 2.0; 95\% CI 1.2, 3.6), having a chronic medical condition (OR 2.0; 95\% CI 1.0, 3.9), and believing antibiotics to be helpful for viral (OR 2.5; 95\% CI 1.3, 4.7) or bacterial (OR 2.6; 95\% CI 1.2, 6.7) respiratory illnesses to be independently associated with antibiotic use for respiratory illnesses during the previous year. There was a trend toward lower previous antibiotic use among those believing antibiotics to be helpful for bacterial illness but not for viral illness.
CONCLUSIONS: A lack of understanding about antibiotic effectiveness exists in the community. Increased previous antibiotic use among those believing antibiotics to be effective for viral illnesses suggests that improvements are needed in communications to patients and the public about antibiotic appropriateness.},

	abstract = {Purpose Nowadays, the development of antibiotic resistance represents one of the most important issues of the global public health. The incorrect use of antimicrobial drugs is recognized as one of the leading causes of antibiotic resistance. Therefore, a better understanding of the existing pieces of evidence pertaining knowledge and attitudes about antibiotic and antibiotic resistance in the general population worldwide is advisable.
Methods A systematic review and proportion meta-analyses were performed through PubMed and Scopus scientiﬁc databases. Cross-sectional studies published from January 2000 to November 2013 and investigating knowledge about antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance were included.
Results Overall, 26 studies have been selected for the systematic review, and 24 of these were included in the meta-analyses. A lack of knowledge about antibiotics was detected. In particular, 33.7\% (95\%CI 25.2–42.8) of the sample did not know that antibiotics can treat bacterial infections, and 53.9\% (95\%CI 41.6–66.0) of them did not know that antibiotics are not useful against viruses. Besides, although 59.4\% (95\%CI 45.7–72.4) of the sample was aware of antibiotic resistance, 26.9\% (95\%CI 16.6–38.7) of them did not know that misuse of antibiotics can lead to this problem. Finally, 47.1\% (95\%CI 36.1–58.2) of the subjects stop taking antibiotics when they start feeling better.
Conclusions It would be necessary to strengthen educational initiatives in the community and to push physicians to correctly inform patients in order to make them aware of the importance of a correct behavior concerning antibiotic consumption. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

To understand how parents influence the prescribing patterns of physicians and what strategies physicians believe are important if we are going to reduce inappropriate use of oral antimicrobial agents. Designs and Methods. One thousand pediatricians who are members of the American Academy of Pediatrics were asked to complete a semi-structured questionnaire. The physicians were chosen randomly by the American Academy of Pediatrics.
Results. Nine hundred fifteen pediatricians were eligible and 610 surveys were analyzable, for a response rate of 67\%. The majority of respondents were male (56\%), worked in a group practice (51\%), saw an average of 114 patients per week and were in practice for 14 years. Forty percent of the pediatricians indicated that 10 or more times in the past month a parent had requested an antibiotic when the physician did not feel it was indicated. Forty-eight percent reported that parents always, most of the time, or often pressure them to prescribe antibiotics when their children are ill but antibiotics are not indicated. In follow-up questions, approximately one-third of physicians reported they occasionally or more frequently comply with these requests. Seventyeight percent felt that educating parents would be the single most important program for reducing inappropriate oral antibiotic use and 54\% indicated that parental pressure, in contrast to concerns about legal liability (12\%) or need to be efficient in practice (19\%), contributed most to inappropriate use of oral antibiotics.
Conclusions. Pediatricians acknowledge prescribing antimicrobial agents when they are not indicated. Pediatricians believe educating parents is necessary to promote the judicious use of antimicrobial agents. Pediatrics},

	abstract = {Background: Health literacy concerns the knowledge and competences of persons to meet the complex demands of health in modern society. Although its importance is increasingly recognised, there is no consensus about the definition of health literacy or about its conceptual dimensions, which limits the possibilities for measurement and comparison. The aim of the study is to review definitions and models on health literacy to develop an integrated definition and conceptual model capturing the most comprehensive evidence-based dimensions of health literacy.
Methods: A systematic literature review was performed to identify definitions and conceptual frameworks of health literacy. A content analysis of the definitions and conceptual frameworks was carried out to identify the central dimensions of health literacy and develop an integrated model.
Results: The review resulted in 17 definitions of health literacy and 12 conceptual models. Based on the content analysis, an integrative conceptual model was developed containing 12 dimensions referring to the knowledge, motivation and competencies of accessing, understanding, appraising and applying health-related information within the healthcare, disease prevention and health promotion setting, respectively.
Conclusions: Based upon this review, a model is proposed integrating medical and public health views of health literacy. The model can serve as a basis for developing health literacy enhancing interventions and provide a conceptual basis for the development and validation of measurement tools, capturing the different dimensions of health literacy within the healthcare, disease prevention and health promotion settings.},

	abstract = {Inductive generalization, where people go beyond the data provided, is a basic cognitive capability, and it underpins theoretical accounts of learning, categorization, and decision making. To complete the inductive leap needed for generalization, people must make a key ‘‘sampling’’ assumption about how the available data were generated. Previous models have considered two extreme possibilities, known as strong and weak sampling. In strong sampling, data are assumed to have been deliberately generated as positive examples of a concept, whereas in weak sampling, data are assumed to have been generated without any restrictions. We develop a more general account of sampling that allows for an intermediate mixture of these two extremes, and we test its usefulness. In two experiments, we show that most people complete simple one-dimensional generalization tasks in a way that is consistent with their believing in some mixture of strong and weak sampling, but that there are large individual differences in the relative emphasis different people give to each type of sampling. We also show experimentally that the relative emphasis of the mixture is inﬂuenced by the structure of the available information. We discuss the psychological meaning of mixing strong and weak sampling, and possible extensions of our modeling approach to richer problems of inductive generalization.},

This idea is investigated through an examination of premise non-monotonicity, in which adding premises to a category-based argument weakens rather than strengthens it. Relevance theories explain this phenomenon in terms of people’s sensitivity to the relationships among premise items. We show that a Bayesian model of category-based induction taking premise sampling assumptions and category similarity into account complements such theories and yields two important predictions: First, that sensitivity to premise relationships can be violated by inducing a weak sampling assumption; and second, that premise monotonicity should be restored as a result. We test these predictions with an experiment that manipulates people’s assumptions in this regard, showing that people draw qualitatively different conclusions in each case.},

Experiments 1 and 2 show that this effect emerges in hierarchically structured domains when a negative observation from a different category is added to a positive observation. They also demonstrate that this is related to a speciﬁc kind of shift in the reasoner’s hypothesis space. Experiment 3 shows that the effect depends on the assumptions that the reasoner makes about how inductive arguments are constructed. Non-monotonic reasoning occurs when people believe the facts were put together by a helpful communicator, but monotonicity is restored when they believe the observations were sampled randomly from the environment.},

In this paper we revisit this topic, arguing that there are 2 qualitatively different ways in which a Bayesian model could be constructed. The most common approach uses a Bayesian model as a normative standard upon which to license a claim about optimality. In the alternative approach, a descriptive Bayesian model need not correspond to any claim that the underlying cognition is optimal or rational, and is used solely as a tool for instantiating a substantive psychological theory. We present 3 case studies in which these 2 perspectives lead to different computational models and license different conclusions about human cognition. We demonstrate how the descriptive Bayesian approach can be used to answer different sorts of questions than the optimal approach, especially when combined with principled tools for model evaluation and model selection. More generally we argue for the importance of making a clear distinction between the 2 perspectives. Considerable confusion results when descriptive models and optimal models are conflated, and if Bayesians are to avoid contributing to this confusion it is important to avoid making normative claims when none are intended.},

In contrast, dual-process accounts propose that these inferences depend upon 2 qualitatively different mechanisms. To distinguish between these accounts, we derived a set of single-process and dual-process models based on an overarching signal detection framework. We then used signed difference analysis to test each model against data from an argument evaluation task, in which induction and deduction judgments are elicited for sets of valid and invalid arguments. Three data sets were analyzed: data from Singmann and Klauer (2011), a database of argument evaluation studies, and the results of an experiment designed to test model predictions. Of the large set of testable models, we found that almost all could be rejected, including all 2-dimensional models. The only testable model able to account for all 3 data sets was a model with 1 dimension of argument strength and independent decision criteria for induction and deduction judgments. We conclude that despite the popularity of dual-process accounts, current results from the argument evaluation task are best explained by a single-process account that incorporates separate decision thresholds for inductive and deductive inferences.},

Aim: To provide a systematic review of qualitative research on antibiotic prescribing decisions in hospitals worldwide, including broad-spectrum antibiotic use.
Methods: A systematic search of qualitative research on antibiotic prescribing for adult hospital patients published between 2007 and 2017 was conducted. Drawing on the Health Belief Model, a framework synthesis was conducted to assess threat perceptions associated with antimicrobial resistance, and perceived beneﬁts and barriers associated with antibiotic stewardship. Findings: The risk of antimicrobial resistance was generally perceived to be serious, but the abstract and long-term nature of its consequences led physicians to doubt personal susceptibility. While prescribers believed in the beneﬁts of optimizing prescribing, the direct link between over-prescribing and antimicrobial resistance was questioned, and prescribers’ behaviour change was frequently considered futile when ﬁghting the complex problem of antimicrobial resistance. The salience of individual patient risks was a key barrier to more conservative prescribing. Physicians perceived broad-spectrum antibiotics to be effective and low risk; prescribing broad-spectrum antibiotics involved low cognitive demand and enabled physicians to manage patient expectations. Antibiotic prescribing decisions in low-income countries were shaped by a context of heightened uncertainty and risk due to poor microbiology and infection control services.
Conclusions: When tackling antimicrobial resistance, the tensions between immediate individual risks and long-term collective risks need to be taken into account. Efforts to reduce diagnostic uncertainty and to change risk perceptions will be critical in shifting practice.},

	abstract = {Objectives: China has very high rates of antibiotic resistance and a health care system that provides strong incentives for over-prescribing. This paper describes the findings of a qualitative study in a province of southern China that seeks to assess knowledge, attitudes, and practices in relation to the use of antibiotics.
Methods: Semi-structured interviews with patients and health workers at provincial, county, township, and village level. Interviews used four probes (common cold, cough, mild diarrhoea and tiredness) where antibiotics were not indicated, supplemented by questions on knowledge, attitudes, and practices. These data were supplemented by two focus groups, with medical students and pharmacists, and discussions with participants at a national conference on antibiotic use.
Results: Coughs and diarrhoea are almost universally treated with antibiotics, while the cold is normally treated with antivirals instead or as well. Many physicians are aware that the cold is usually self-limiting but believe that they can speed recovery and that they are responding to patient expectations. Most physicians and many patients are aware of the phenomenon of antibiotic resistance, although it is often seen as a property acquired by the patient and not the micro-organism. Physicians face financial incentives to prescribe, with profit splitting with pharmaceutical suppliers. Sales profits form a major part of a hospital’s income. National guidance on use of antibiotics is fragmentary and incomplete.
Conclusion: The misuse of antibiotics poses considerable risks. Effective action will require a multi-faceted strategy including education, based on an understanding of existing beliefs, the replacement of perverse incentives with those promoting best practice, and investment in improved surveillance. Much of this will require action at national level.},

	abstract = {Background: The inappropriate use of antimicrobials drives antimicrobial resistance. We conducted a study to map physician decision-making processes for acute infection management in secondary care to identify potential targets for quality improvement interventions.
Methods: Physicians newly qualified to consultant level participated in semi-structured interviews. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim for analysis using NVIVO11.0 software. Grounded theory methodology was applied. Analytical categories were created using constant comparison approach to the data and participants were recruited to the study until thematic saturation was reached.
Results: Twenty physicians were interviewed. The decision pathway for the management of acute infections follows a Bayesian-like step-wise approach, with information processed and systematically added to prior assumptions to guide management. The main emerging themes identified as determinants of the decision-making of individual physicians were (1) perceptions of providing ‘optimal’ care for the patient with infection by providing rapid and often intravenous therapy; (2) perceptions that stopping/de-escalating therapy was a senior doctor decision with junior trainees not expected to contribute; and (3) expectation of interactions with local guidelines and microbiology service advice. Feedback on review of junior doctor prescribing decisions was often lacking, causing frustration and confusion on appropriate practice within this cohort.
Conclusion: Interventions to improve infection management must incorporate mechanisms to promote distribution of responsibility for decisions made. The disparity between expectations of prescribers to start but not review/stop therapy must be urgently addressed with mechanisms to improve communication and feedback to junior prescribers to facilitate their continued development as prudent antimicrobial prescribers.},

	abstract = {Background: Despite its popularity as an inferential framework, classical null hypothesis signiﬁcance testing (NHST) has several restrictions. Bayesian analysis can be used to complement NHST, however, this approach has been underutilized largely due to a dearth of accessible software options. JASP is a recently developed open-source statistical package that facilitates both Bayesian and NHST analysis using a graphical interface. This article provides an applied introduction to Bayesian inference with Bayes factors using JASP.
Methods: We use JASP to compare and contrast Bayesian alternatives for several common classical null hypothesis signiﬁcance tests: correlations, frequency distributions, t-tests, ANCOVAs, and ANOVAs. These examples are also used to illustrate the strengths and limitations of both NHST and Bayesian hypothesis testing.
Results: A comparison of NHST and Bayesian inferential frameworks demonstrates that Bayes factors can complement p-values by providing additional information for hypothesis testing. Namely, Bayes factors can quantify relative evidence for both alternative and null hypotheses. Moreover, the magnitude of this evidence can be presented as an easy-to-interpret odds ratio.
Conclusions: While Bayesian analysis is by no means a new method, this type of statistical inference has been largely inaccessible for most psychiatry researchers. JASP provides a straightforward means of performing reproducible Bayesian hypothesis tests using a graphical “point and click” environment that will be familiar to researchers conversant with other graphical statistical packages, such as SPSS.},

We compared two methods for ensuring data quality on MTurk: attention check questions (ACQs) and restricting participation to MTurk workers with high reputation (above 95\% approval ratings). In Experiment 1, we found that high reputation workers rarely failed ACQs and provided higher quality data than low reputation workers; ACQs improved data quality only for low reputation workers, and only in some of the cases. Experiment 2 corroborated these findings and also suggested that more productive high reputation workers produce the highest quality data. We conclude that sampling high reputation workers can ensure high quality data without having to resort to using ACQs ,which may lead to selection bias if participants who fail ACQs are excluded post-hoc.},

This lack of usage may stem from fears of distorting treatment effects and uncertainty regarding which type to use (e.g., instructional manipulation checks [IMCs] or assessments of whether stimuli alter a latent independent variable of interest). Here, we first categorize the main variants and argue that factual manipulation checks (FMCs)—that is, objective questions about key elements of the experiment—can identify individual-level attentiveness to experimental information and, as a consequence, better enable researchers to diagnose experimental findings. We then find, through four replication studies, little evidence that FMC placement affects treatment effects, and that placing FMCs immediately post-outcome does not attenuate FMC passage rates. Additionally, FMC and IMC passage rates are only weakly related, suggesting that each technique identifies different sets of attentive subjects. Thus, unlike other methods, FMCs can confirm attentiveness to experimental protocols.},

Research has, however, reported wide diﬀerences in individuals’ desires to be involved in the decision-making process, and these diﬀerences in preferences are likely to be the result of a number of factors including age, education and numeracy.
Objective To investigate whether patients at genetic risk for cancer had preferences for shared decision making that diﬀered depending on medical domain (general health vs. cancer) and whether decision preferences are linked to numeracy abilities.
Methods Four hundred and seventy-six women who consented to participate in response to an email sent by a local branch of the U.S.-based Cancer Genetics Network (CGN) to its members. Participants completed the Control Preference Scale, as well as an objective and subjective numeracy scales.
Results Decision domain (cancer vs. general health) was not associated with women’s preferences for involvement in decision making. Objective and subjective numeracy predicted a preference for decision involvement in general, and only objective numeracy was predictive with regard to cancer.
Conclusion Participants were equally likely to state they wanted to play an active, collaborative or passive role in both medical domains (general and cancer). High-numeracy participants were more likely to express a desire for an active role in general and in case they were diagnosed with cancer.},

	abstract = {Objective: Risk communication tools can facilitate patients’ understanding of risk information. In this novel study, we examine the hypothesis that risk communication methods tailored to individuals' preferences can increase risk comprehension.
Methods: Preferences for breast cancer risk formats, and risk comprehension data were collected using an online survey from 361 women at high risk for breast cancer. Women’s initial preferences were assessed by asking them which of the following risk formats would be the clearest: 1) percentage, 2) frequency, 3) bar graph, 4) pictogram, and 5) comparison to other women. Next, women were presented with five different formats for displaying cancer risks and asked to interpret the risk information presented. Finally, they were asked again which risk format they preferred.
Results: Initial preferences for risk formats were not associated with risk comprehension scores. However, women with lower risk comprehension scores were more likely to update their risk format preferences after they evaluated risks in different formats. Less numerate women were more likely to prefer graphical rather than numeric risk formats. Importantly, we found that women preferring graphical risk formats had lower risk comprehension in these formats compared to numeric formats. In contrast, women preferring numeric formats performed equally well across formats.
Conclusions: Our findings suggest that tailoring risk communication to patient preferences may not improve understanding of medical risks, particularly for less numerate women, and point to the potential perils of tailoring risk communication formats to patient preferences.

	abstract = {Statistical analysis of both experimental and observational data is central to medical research. Unfortunately, the process of conventional statistical analysis is poorly understood by many medical scientists. This is due, in part, to the counter-intuitive nature of the basic tools of traditional (frequencybased) statistical inference. For example, the proper deﬁnition of a conventional 95\% conﬁdence interval is quite confusing. It is based upon the imaginary results of a series of hypothetical repetitions of the data generation process and subsequent analysis. Not surprisingly, this formal deﬁnition is often ignored and a 95\% conﬁdence interval is widely taken to represent a range of values that is associated with a 95\% probability of containing the true value of the parameter being estimated. Working within the traditional framework of frequency-based statistics, this interpretation is fundamentally incorrect. It is perfectly valid, however, if one works within the framework of Bayesian statistics and assumes a ‘prior distribution’ that is uniform on the scale of the main outcome variable. This reﬂects a limited equivalence between conventional and Bayesian statistics that can be used to facilitate a simple Bayesian interpretation based on the results of a standard analysis. Such inferences provide direct and understandable answers to many important types of question in medical research. For example, they can be used to assist decision making based upon studies with unavoidably low statistical power, where non-signiﬁcant results are all too often, and wrongly, interpreted as implying ‘no effect’. They can also be used to overcome the confusion that can result when statistically signiﬁcant effects are too small to be clinically relevant. This paper describes the theoretical basis of the Bayesian-based approach and illustrates its application with a practical example that investigates the prevalence of major cardiac defects in a cohort of children born using the assisted reproduction technique known as ICSI (intracytoplasmic sperm injection).},

	abstract = {Background: Consumers receive over 27 million antibiotic prescriptions annually in Australian primary healthcare. Hence, consumers are a key group to engage in the fight against antibiotic resistance. There is a paucity of research pertaining to consumers in the Australian healthcare environment. This study aimed to investigate the perspectives, attitudes and behaviours of Australian consumers on antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance, to inform national programs for reducing inappropriate antibiotic consumption.
Method: Semi-structured interviews with 32 consumers recruited via convenience and snowball sampling from a university population in South East Queensland. Interview transcripts were deductively and inductively coded. Main themes were identified using iterative thematic analysis.
Results: Three themes emerged from the analysis, to elucidate factors affecting antibiotic use: (a) prescription type; (b) consumer attitudes, behaviours, skills and knowledge; and (c) consumer engagement with antibiotic resistance. Consumers held mixed views regarding the use of delayed antibiotic prescriptions, and were often not made aware of the use of repeat antibiotic prescriptions. Consumers with regular general practitioners were more likely to have shared expectations regarding minimising the use of antibiotics. Even so, advice or information mediated by general practitioners was influential with all consumers; and helped to prevent inappropriate antibiotic use behaviours. Consumers were not aware of the free Return of Unwanted Medicines service offered by pharmacies and disposed of leftover antibiotics through household waste. To engage with mitigating antibiotic resistance, consumers required specific information. Previous public health campaigns raising awareness of antibiotics were largely not seen by this sample of consumers.
Conclusions: Australian consumers have specific information needs regarding prescribed antibiotics to enable appropriate antibiotic use behaviours. Consumers also have expectations for high quality general practice consults conducted in a manner that increases consumer confidence in the treatment decision, regardless of whether an antibiotic is prescribed. To reduce inappropriate consumption of antibiotics and to more fully engage Australian consumers in mitigating antibiotic resistance, changes in health policy and practice are required.},

	abstract = {Objectives: To identify and quantify inappropriate systemic antibiotic prescribing in primary care in England, and ultimately to determine the potential for reduction in prescribing of antibiotics.
Methods: Primary care data from 2013–15 recorded in The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database were used. Potentially inappropriate prescribing events in the database were identiﬁed by: (i) comparing prescribing events against treatment guidelines; (ii) comparing actual proportions of consultations resulting in prescription for a set of conditions with the ideal proportions derived from expert opinion; and (iii) identifying high prescribers and their number of prescriptions above an age- and body-system-speciﬁc benchmark.
Results: Applying the most conservative assumptions, 8.8\% of all systemic antibiotic prescriptions in English primary care were identiﬁed as inappropriate, and in the least conservative scenario 23.1\% of prescriptions were inappropriate. All practices had non-zero reduction potentials, ranging from 6.4\% to 43.5\% in the middle scenario. The four conditions that contributed most to inappropriate prescribing were sore throat (23.0\% of identiﬁed inappropriate prescriptions), cough (22.2\%), sinusitis (7.6\%) and acute otitis media (5.7\%). One-third of all antibiotic prescriptions lacked an informative diagnostic code.
Conclusions: This work demonstrates (i) the existence of substantial inappropriate antibiotic prescribing and (ii) poor diagnostic coding in English primary care. All practices (not just the high prescribers) should engage in efforts to improve antimicrobial stewardship. Better diagnostic coding, more precise prescribing guidelines and a deeper understanding of appropriate long-term uses of antibiotics would allow identiﬁcation of further potential for reductions.},

The third, most critical, issue concerns the committee's recommendations for detecting errors in randomization. This is an area where there is evidence of widespread confusion about experimental methods throughout our major journals. Given that a goal of the Journal of Experimental Political Science is promoting best practices and a better understanding of experimental methods across the discipline, we recommend changes to the Standards that will allow the journal to play a leading role in correcting these misunderstandings.},

The present research explored the implications of this eVect for the possibility that high credibility sources can be associated with more or less persuasion than low credibility sources. In two experiments, it is demonstrated that when people generate primarily positive thoughts in response to a message (e.g., because the message contains strong arguments) and then learn of the source, high source credibility leads to more favorable attitudes than does low source credibility. When people have primarily negative thoughts in response to a message (e.g., because it contains weak arguments), however, this eVect is reversed—that is, high source credibility leads to less favorable attitudes than does low source credibility.},

Statistical information is often provided to ensure informed decision making. However, few theoretical models have addressed the role of comprehension of such information in screening decisions. In an experiment, we studied how cognitive skills, emotions, and a priori beliefs about screening affect comprehension of the evidence of benefits and harms from screening and intentions to get screened. Young adults (N ϭ 347) received information about a disease for which a screening test was available and numerical information about the benefits and harms from screening. Results showed that comprehension and perceptions of benefits are central to decisions; however, lay perceptions of harms along the screening cascade require further study. Numeracy, science literacy, and emotions can promote informed decision making by facilitating comprehension of the evidence. At the same time emotions and beliefs resulting from persuasive campaigns can have strong effects on screening intentions beyond the available evidence. To apply to screening procedures where informed decision making is recommended, theoretical models of screening decisions need to include comprehension of benefits and harms, and account for how cognitive skills, emotions, and beliefs influence comprehension and decisions.},

The authors show that failing to attend to attrition rates in online panels has grave consequences. By introducing experimental confounds, unattended attrition misled them to draw mind-boggling yet false conclusions: that recalling a few happy events is considerably more effortful than recalling many happy events, and that imagining applying eyeliner leads to weight loss (Study 2). In addition, attrition rate misled them to draw a logical yet false conclusion: that explaining one’s view on gun rights decreases progun sentiment (Study 3).

In 1997, the Cochrane Collaboration Back Review Group published method guidelines for systematic reviews. Since its publication, new methodologic evidence emerged and more experience was acquired in conducting reviews.
Methods. All reviews and protocols of the Back Review Group were assessed for compliance with the 1997 method guidelines. Also, the most recent version of the Cochrane Handbook (4.1) was checked for new recommendations. In addition, some important topics that were not addressed in the 1997 method guidelines were included (e.g., methods for qualitative analysis, reporting of conclusions, and discussion of clinical relevance of the results). In May 2002, preliminary results were presented and discussed in a workshop. In two rounds, a list of all possible recommendations and the ﬁnal draft were circulated for comments among the editors of the Back Review Group.
Results. The recommendations are divided in ﬁve categories: literature search, inclusion criteria, methodologic quality assessment, data extraction, and data analysis. Each recommendation is classiﬁed in minimum criteria and further guidance. Additional recommendations are included regarding assessment of clinical relevance, and reporting of results and conclusions.
Conclusions. Systematic reviews need to be conducted as carefully as the trials they report and, to achieve full impact, systematic reviews need to meet high methodologic standards.

	abstract = {PURPOSE Recent evidence in Latino communities indicates substantial self-medication with antibiotics obtained without a prescription (WORx). We implemented and evaluated a culturally sensitive educational intervention to decrease antibiotic self-medication.
METHODS We conducted a community-based intervention with preintervention and postintervention measures in the intervention community (Charleston, South Carolina) as well as a postintervention measure in a control community (Greenville, South Carolina) 200 miles away. The 9-month culturally sensitive intervention included multiple media sources (pamphlets, radio, newspapers). We evaluated the use of antibiotics WORx in the United States, as well as the likelihood of importing antibiotics, by surveying Latino adults in the intervention (n = 250) and in the control community (n = 250).
RESULTS Most adults in the intervention community (69\%) and the control community (60\%) reported some exposure to messages about the inappropriate use of antibiotics, and 25.9\% in the intervention community and 8.6\% in the control community reported seeing our patient education pamphlets. A substantial proportion of Latino adults in both the intervention (31\%) and control communities (20\%) have obtained antibiotics WORx in the United States. In multivariate analyses, exposure to an educational message was not a significant predictor of having acquired antibiotics WORx in the United States in past 12 months. The primary predictor of respondents’ having acquired antibiotics WORx in the United States was whether they had bought antibiotics WORx outside the United States.
CONCLUSIONS Novel approaches are needed to decrease the use of antibiotics WORx in Latino communities, as focusing only on education may not be sufficient to change behaviors common in their home countries.},

	abstract = {This paper examines conceptions of trust among three groups of respondents diagnosed with either breast cancer, Lyme disease or mental illness. Interviews were carried out using an open-ended interview guide to explore how patients made assessments of trust in their doctors and health care plans. The guide followed a conceptual approach that asked questions about competence, agency/®duciary responsibility, control, disclosure and con®dentiality. Respondents were given ample opportunity to raise other areas of concern. The data were organized using the NUDIST7 software package for the analysis of non-numerical and unstructured qualitative data. Patients viewed trust as an iterative process and commonly tested their physicians against their knowledge and expectations. Interpersonal competence, involving caring, concern and compassion, was the most common aspect of trust reported, with listening as a central focus. Most patient comments referred to learnable skills and not simply to personality characteristics. Technical competence also received high priority but was often assessed by reputation or interpersonal cues. Patients were much concerned that doctors be their agents and ®ght for their interests with health care plans. Disclosure and con®dentiality were less common concerns; most patients anticipated that doctors would be honest with them and respect their con®dences. Patients' responses also appeared to vary by their disease, their socio-demographic characteristics, their involvement with self-help groups, and how their illness conditions unfolded. 7 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

	abstract = {Background Observational and experimental studies of the diagnostic task have demonstrated the importance of the first hypotheses that come to mind for accurate diagnosis. A prototype decision support system (DSS) designed to support GPs’ first impressions has been integrated with a commercial electronic health record (EHR) system. Aim To evaluate the prototype DSS in a high-fidelity simulation. Design and setting Within-participant design: 34 GPs consulted with six standardised patients (actors) using their usual EHR. On a different day, GPs used the EHR with the integrated DSS to consult with six other patients, matched for difficulty and counterbalanced.
Method Entering the reason for encounter triggered the DSS, which provided a patient-specific list of potential diagnoses, and supported coding of symptoms during the consultation. At each consultation, GPs recorded their diagnosis and management. At the end, they completed a usability questionnaire. The actors completed a satisfaction questionnaire after each consultation.
Results There was an 8–9\% absolute improvement in diagnostic accuracy when the DSS was used. This improvement was significant (odds ratio [OR] 1.41, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.13 to 1.77, P{\textless}0.01). There was no associated increase of investigations ordered or consultation length. GPs coded significantly more data when using the DSS (mean 12.35 with the DSS versus 1.64 without), and were generally satisfied with its usability. Patient satisfaction ratings were the same for consultations with and without the DSS.
Conclusion The DSS prototype was successfully employed in simulated consultations of high fidelity, with no measurable influences on patient satisfaction. The substantially increased data coding can operate as motivation for future DSS adoption.},

At some previous time, one third of the students had taken an antibiotic prescribed for an earlier illness or for another person.

	abstract = {Objective: To estimate survival time and age-speciﬁc mortality rates of an HIV-infected population compared with that of the general population. Design: Population-based cohort study. Setting: All HIV-infected persons receiving care in Denmark from 1995 to 2005. Patients: Each member of the nationwide Danish HIV Cohort Study was matched with as many as 99 persons from the general population according to sex, date of birth, and municipality of residence.
Measurements: The authors computed Kaplan–Meier life tables with age as the time scale to estimate survival from age 25 years. Patients with HIV infection and corresponding persons from the general population were observed from the date of the patient’s HIV diagnosis until death, emigration, or 1 May 2005.
Results: 3990 HIV-infected patients and 379 872 persons from the general population were included in the study, yielding 22 744 (median, 5.8 y/person) and 2 689 287 (median, 8.4 years/person) person-years of observation. Three percent of participants were lost to follow-up. From age 25 years, the median survival was 19.9 years (95\% CI, 18.5 to 21.3) among patients with HIV infection and 51.1 years (CI, 50.9 to 51.5) among the general population. For HIV-infected patients, survival increased to 32.5 years (CI, 29.4 to 34.7) during the 2000 to 2005 period. In the subgroup that excluded persons with known hepatitis C coinfection (16\%), median survival was 38.9 years (CI, 35.4 to 40.1) during this same period. The relative mortality rates for patients with HIV infection compared with those for the general population decreased with increasing age, whereas the excess mortality rate increased with increasing age. Limitations: The observed mortality rates are assumed to apply beyond the current maximum observation time of 10 years.
Conclusions: The estimated median survival is more than 35 years for a young person diagnosed with HIV infection in the late highly active antiretroviral therapy era. However, an ongoing effort is still needed to further reduce mortality rates for these persons compared with the general population.”21},

	abstract = {Introduction We aimed to examine the characteristics of antibiotic awareness campaigns (AAC) conducted on a national or regional level since 2010.
Methods In October 2016, the WHO invited stakeholders involved in the planning or conduct of AACs to answer a web questionnaire. We solicited general information about the characteristics of the AAC, with a particular focus on key messages supporting optimal use of antibiotics.
Results Stakeholders in 93 countries were contacted and 55 countries responded. Overall, 60 AACs from 16 low/middle-income countries (LMIC) and 31 high-income countries were identified. Forty-five campaigns (75\%) were conducted on a national level and most of them (47/60; 78\%) were organised by public health authorities and publicly funded. There were no major differences between LMICs and high-income countries in the types of key messages. The scientifically questionable ‘Finish your prescription’ slogan was used by 31 AACs (52\%). A One Health approach was mentioned in 13/60 AACs (22\%). Most messages were universally applicable; adaptation to locally prevalent public misconceptions was not systematic. The evaluation of the impact of campaigns was still incomplete, as only 18 AACs (30\%) assessed their impact on antibiotic use.
Conclusion For future AACs, it seems essential to base messages more rigorously on scientific evidence, context specificities and behavioural change theory. A new generation of messages that encourage first-choice use of narrow spectrum antibiotics is needed, reflecting international efforts to preserve broad spectrum antibiotic classes. Evaluation of the impact of AACs remains suboptimal.},

These challenges have potential negative impacts, especially in search domains such as health search. Existing information retrieval (IR) systems offer users little (if any) guidance as to how to reduce the likelihood of such negative impacts. The sum of these problems provides motivation for experiments to identify elements of existing IR environments that might provide low-cost options to the user for improved search outcomes. An online user study (N = 90) was performed allowing users to visit search results for 10 medical search tasks adapted from previous research. Analysis was performed on all search results visited in the experiment, with a total of 523 unique web pages collectively visited, with additional analysis performed on a set of 10,000 popular websites. The analysis suggests that the best strategy for users with the goal of protecting their privacy and simultaneously finding more accurate information for their medical search tasks, is to visit websites with .org and .gov in the URL. There is some evidence that HTTP is a useful predictor as well. Existing literature is limited with respect to utilization of these features and thus the findings, along with the annotations, are a key contribution for future research, for which possible directions are provided.},

Those in the complete information conditions responded to items on 4 biases: action bias, social norm, source discrediting, and information neglect. In 2 follow-up experiments (n₁ = 150; n₂ = 732), we aimed to counteract the action bias by reframing the perception of the resting option as an action. Complete information provision reduced but did not eliminate inappropriate preferences for antibiotics. Around 10\% of people wanted antibiotics even when informed they are harmful and offer no benefit and even when the alternative option (i.e., rest) was framed as an active treatment option. Results suggest an action bias underpins this preference but appears challenging to counteract. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

We compare findings with recent studies of retracted papers in economics, and business and management, to profile practices that are likely to be problematic in cognate social science disciplines. In psychology, the principal reason for retraction was data fabrication. Retractions took longer to make, and generally were from higher ranked and more prestigious journals, than in the two cognate disciplines. We recommend that journal editors should be more forthcoming in the reasons they provide for article retractions. We also recommend that the discipline of psychology gives a greater priority to the publication of replication studies; initiates a debate about how to respond to failed replications; adopts a more critical attitude to the importance of attaining statistical significance; discourages p-hacking and Hypothesizing After Results are Known (HARKing); assesses the long-term effects of pre-registering research; and supports stronger procedures to attest to the authenticity of data in research papers. Our contribution locates these issues in the context of a growing crisis of confidence in the value of social science research. We also challenge individual researchers to reassert the primacy of disinterested academic inquiry above pressures that can lead to an erosion of scholarly integrity.},

	abstract = {Objectives To reduce overprescribing, health campaigns urge physicians to provide people with information regarding appropriate antibiotic use and encourage the public to trust their physicians’ prescribing decisions. We test (1) whether providing individuals with complete information about the viral aetiology of an illness and the ineffectiveness of antibiotics will reduce inappropriate antibiotic expectations, (2) whether individuals with greater trust in their physician will have lower expectations, and (3) whether individuals with greater trust in their physician will benefit more from the complete information provision and have lower expectations. Design Experiment 1 features a between-subjects design (information provision: baseline vs. complete information) with a general measure of participants’ trust in their physician. Experiment 2 features a 2 (physician trustworthiness: low vs. high) × 2 (information provision: baseline vs. complete information) between-subjects design. Methods In Experiment 1, participants (n = 366) reported their trust in their physician, read a vignette describing a hypothetical consultation with a physician for a viral cold and then expressed their expectations for antibiotics. In Experiment 2, participants (n = 380) read a vignette of a consultation with a physician for a viral ear infection then expressed their expectations for antibiotics. Results In both experiments, the provision of complete information significantly reduced inappropriate expectations for antibiotics. Greater trust in physicians was associated with higher antibiotic expectations in Experiment 1, but lower expectations in Experiment 2. In both experiments, trust in physicians appeared to facilitate the effect of information provision, but this effect was weak and inconsistent. Conclusion Providing information about viral aetiology and the ineffectiveness and side effects of antibiotics reduces inappropriate antibiotic expectations. Further research into the effect of trust in physicians as a moderator of the effect information provision is required, particularly given the recent increase in trust-based antibiotic campaigns. Statement of contribution What is already known Inappropriate expectations for antibiotics encourage overprescribing in primary care. To reduce inappropriate expectations, interventions often aim to educate people about antibiotics and encourage them to trust their physician. What does this study add Causal evidence that clinical information provision reduces but does not eliminate inappropriate antibiotic expectations. We find that increased trust in physicians is not always associated with lower expectations for antibiotics. Although increased trust seemed to boost the effect of information provision, this effect was weak and inconsistent.},

The accelerating tide of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major worldwide policy concern. Like climate change, the incentives for individual decision-makers do not take into account the costs to society at large. AMR represents an impending “tragedy of the commons,” and there is an immediate need for collective action to prevent future harm. Roope et al. review the issues associated with AMR from an economics perspective and draw parallels with climate change. A major stumbling block for both challenges is to build consensus about the best way forward when faced with many uncertainties and inequities.
Science, this issue p. eaau4679
Structured Abstract
BACKGROUNDAntimicrobial resistance (AMR) is increasing, driven by widespread antibiotic use. The wide availability of effective antibiotics is under threat, jeopardizing modern health care. Forecasts of the economic costs are similar to those of a 2°C rise in global average surface temperature, above preindustrial levels. AMR is becoming an urgent priority for policy-makers, and pressure is mounting to secure international commitments to tackle the problem.
ADVANCESEstimating the value of interventions to reduce antibiotic use requires predictions of future levels of antibiotic resistance. However, modeling the trajectory of antibiotic resistance, and how marginal changes in antibiotic consumption contribute to resistance, is complex. The challenge of estimating the resulting impact on health and the economy is similarly daunting. As with the cost of climate change, estimates of total AMR costs are fraught with uncertainty and may be far too low. Much of the uncertainty arises from the complexity of estimating the cost of changes in overall resistance levels. This cost depends on various factors: which drug and pathogen are involved, the mechanism of antibiotic resistance, the prevalence of that pathogen, the types of infections it causes and their level of transmissibility, the health burden of those infections, and whether alternative treatments are available.Effective new antibiotics are urgently needed. However, without government intervention, R\&D for antibiotics is rarely profitable, and most major pharmaceutical companies have left the field. New ways are needed to make antibiotic development profitable, decoupling profits from volumes sold.
OUTLOOKAnalogies can be drawn between climate change and AMR, both of which have been described as a global “tragedy of the commons.” There is some consensus that we should treat carbon emissions reduction as an insurance policy against the possibility of a catastrophic climate outcome—and avoid waiting for a definitive optimum-abatement policy. A similar paradigm shift is needed to incentivize both the introduction and valuation of interventions to reduce antibiotic use and R\&D of new antibiotics.Rather than taxing the price and letting the market dictate the quantity of antibiotics supplied, an alternative may be to establish a regulatory body that issues prescribers tradable permits and to allow the market to determine the price. Such an approach could create a predictable revenue stream through more-foreseeable licensing fees for important antibiotics by decoupling the return on investment from the volume used. Approaches such as this could incentivize industry to develop new antibiotics for which there would otherwise be too small a market to provide a sufficient return on investment.Reducing inappropriate antibiotic use while expanding essential access is a difficult challenge, especially in low- and middle-income countries. However, policy-makers and philanthropists are alert to the importance of AMR and increasingly are making substantial research funds available, with much of these funds devoted to the social sciences. We need economists, across many different fields, to engage with this pressing global problem. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/364/6435/eaau4679/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Excess antibiotic use versus access-related mortality in young children.The top map depicts excess: use of so-called “watch” and “reserve” antibiotics in standard units (SU) per 100,000 children under the age of 6. The World Health Organization’s watch group includes antibiotics that are recommended as first- or second-choice treatments for only a small number of infections, owing to greater potential to select for antibiotic resistance. The reserve group includes antibiotics that should be considered last-resort options and used only in the most severe circumstances, when all other alternatives have failed. The bottom map depicts access: simulated estimates of annual deaths from community-acquired bacterial pneumonia, expressed per 100,000 children under the age of 5, which could be averted with universal access to antibiotics.(TOP) Based on data from Y. Hsia et al., Lancet Infect. Dis. 19, 67 (2019), and population estimates from https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/; (BOTTOM) Based on data and estimates from R. Laxminarayan et al., Lancet 387, 168 (2016), and population estimates from https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/
As antibiotic consumption grows, bacteria are becoming increasingly resistant to treatment. Antibiotic resistance undermines much of modern health care, which relies on access to effective antibiotics to prevent and treat infections associated with routine medical procedures. The resulting challenges have much in common with those posed by climate change, which economists have responded to with research that has informed and shaped public policy. Drawing on economic concepts such as externalities and the principal–agent relationship, we suggest how economics can help to solve the challenges arising from increasing resistance to antibiotics. We discuss solutions to the key economic issues, from incentivizing the development of effective new antibiotics to improving antibiotic stewardship through financial mechanisms and regulation.},

	abstract = {The present research explores the relationship between anticipated emotions and pro-environmental decision making comparing two differently valenced emotions: anticipated pride and guilt. In an experimental design, we examined the causal effects of anticipated pride versus guilt on pro-environmental decision making and behavioral intentions by making anticipated emotions (i.e. pride and guilt) salient just prior to asking participants to make a series of environmental decisions. We find evidence that anticipating one’s positive future emotional state from green action just prior to making an environmental decision leads to higher pro-environmental behavioral intentions compared to anticipating one’s negative emotional state from inaction. This finding suggests a rethinking in the domain of environmental and climate change messaging, which has traditionally favored inducing negative emotions such as guilt to promote pro-environmental action. Furthermore, exploratory results comparing anticipated pride and guilt inductions to baseline behavior point toward a reactance eliciting effect of anticipated guilt.},

	abstract = {This paper makes the case for immediate planning for a COVID-19 vaccination uptake strategy in advance of vaccine availability for two reasons: first, the need to build a consensus about the order in which groups of the population will get access to the vaccine; second, to reduce any fear and concerns that exist in relation to vaccination and to create demand for vaccines. A key part of this strategy is to counter the anti-vaccination movement that is already promoting hesitancy and resistance. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic there has been a tsunami of misinformation and conspiracy theories that have the potential to reduce vaccine uptake. To make matters worse, sections of populations in many countries display low trust in governments and official information about the pandemic and how the officials are tackling it. This paper aims to set out in short form critical guidelines that governments and regional bodies should take to enhance the impact of a COVID-19 vaccination strategy. We base our recommendations on a review of existing best practice guidance. This paper aims to assist those responsible for promoting COVID-19 vaccine uptake to digest the mass of guidance that exists and formulate an effective locally relevant strategy. A summary of key guidelines is presented based on best practice guidance.},

For this argument to be tenable, the familywise error rate must be defined in relation to the number of hypotheses that are tested in the same study or article. Under this conceptualization, the familywise error rate is usually unknowable in exploratory analyses because it is usually unclear how many hypotheses have been tested on a spontaneous basis and then omitted from the final research report. In the present article, I argue that it is inappropriate to conceptualize the familywise error rate in relation to the number of hypotheses that are tested. Instead, it is more appropriate to conceptualize familywise error in relation to the number of different tests that are conducted on the same null hypothesis in the same study. Under this conceptualization, alpha-level adjustments in exploratory analyses are (a) less necessary and (b) objectively verifiable. As a result, p values do not lose their meaning in exploratory analyses.},

	abstract = {Nudge interventions – behaviorally-motivated design changes with no ﬁnancial incentives – have quickly expanded from academic studies to larger implementations in so-called Nudge Units in governments. This provides a unique opportunity to compare interventions in research studies, versus at scale. In this paper, we assemble a unique data set including all trials run by two of the largest Nudge Units in the United States, including 126 RCTs covering over 23 million individuals. We compare these trials to a separate sample of nudge trials published in academic journals from two recent meta-analyses. In papers published in academic journals, the average impact of a nudge is very large – an 8.7 percentage point take-up increase over the control. In the Nudge Unit trials, the average impact is still sizable and highly statistically signiﬁcant, but smaller at 1.4 percentage points. We show that a large share of the gap is accounted for by publication bias, exacerbated by low statistical power, in the sample of published papers; in contrast, the Nudge Unit studies are well-powered, a hallmark of “at scale” interventions. Accounting for publication bias, and some diﬀerences in characteristics, reconciles the two estimates. We also compare these results to the predictions of academics and practitioners. Most forecasters overestimate the impact for the Nudge Unit interventions, though nudge practitioners are almost perfectly calibrated.},

Therefore, it is of utmost importance to think of alternatives to the current data business model. The present study investigated how strong the support would be for a monetary payment model among a sample of 210 participants. Participants were asked about their willingness to pay for social media, if in turn their data would be private and other problems concerning social media use would be tackled. Only one-fifth of participants (21.43\%) supported such a model. From the Big Five Personality traits, Agreeableness was positively associated with support of such a model. Finally, data are also provided on how much participants would be willing to pay for social media on a monthly basis. The present study’s findings are of a preliminary nature and will contribute to the start of an important discussion.},

The current online ecosystem has been designed predominantly to capture user attention rather than to promote deliberate cognition and autonomous choice; information overload, finely tuned personalization and distorted social cues, in turn, pave the way for manipulation and the spread of false information. How can transparency and autonomy be promoted instead, thus fostering the positive potential of the web? Effective web governance informed by behavioural research is critically needed to empower individuals online. We identify technologically available yet largely untapped cues that can be harnessed to indicate the epistemic quality of online content, the factors underlying algorithmic decisions and the degree of consensus in online debates. We then map out two classes of behavioural interventions—nudging and boosting— that enlist these cues to redesign online environments for informed and autonomous choice.},

We propose ten considerations to support this principle: (1) implement a phased approach to a ‘new normal’; (2) balance individual rights with the social good; (3) prioritise people at highest risk of negative consequences; (4) provide special support for healthcare workers and care staff; (5) build, strengthen and maintain trust; (6) enlist existing social norms and foster healthy new norms; (7) increase resilience and self-efficacy; (8) use clear and positive language; (9) anticipate and manage misinformation; and (10) engage with media outlets.

	abstract = {Accurate perception of medical probabilities communicated to patients is a cornerstone of informed decision making. People, however, are prone to biases in probability perception. Recently, Pighin and others extended the list of such biases with evidence that “1-in-X” ratios (e.g., “1 in 12”) led to greater perceived probability and worry about health outcomes than “N-in-X*N” ratios (e.g., “10 in 120”). Subsequently, the recommendation was to avoid using “1-in-X” ratios when communicating probabilistic information to patients. To warrant such a recommendation, we conducted 5 well-powered replications and synthesized the available data. We found that 3 out of the 5 replications yielded statistically nonsignificant findings. In addition, our results showed that the “1-in-X” effect was not moderated by numeracy, cognitive reflection, age, or gender. To quantify the evidence for the effect, we conducted a Bayes factor meta-analysis and a traditional meta-analysis of our 5 studies and those of Pighin and others (11 comparisons, N = 1131). The meta-analytical Bayes factor, which allowed assessment of the evidence for the null hypothesis, was very low, providing decisive evidence to support the existence of the “1-in-X” effect. The traditional meta-analysis showed that the overall effect was significant (Hedges’ g = 0.42, 95\% CI 0.29–0.54). Overall, we provide decisive evidence for the existence of the “1-in-X” effect but suggest that it is smaller than previously estimated. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.},

	abstract = {Prior research found that ?1-in-X? ratios led to higher and less accurate subjective probability than ?N-in-X*N? ratios or other formats, even though they featured the same mathematical information. It is unclear, however, whether the effect transfers into health decisions, and the practical significance of the effect is undetermined. Based on previous findings and risk communication theories, we hypothesized that the 1-in-X effect would occur and transfer into relevant decisions. We also tested whether age, gender, and education differences would moderate the 1-in-X effect on decision making. We conducted 3 well-powered experiments (n = 1912) using a sample from the general adult UK population to test our hypotheses, estimated the effect, and excluded a possible methodological explanation for such a transfer. In hypothetical scenarios, participants decided whether to travel to Kenya given the chance of contracting malaria (experiment 1) and whether to take recommended steroids given the side effects (experiments 2 and 3). Across the experiments, we replicated a small to medium 1-in-X effect on the perceived probability (Hedge?s g = ?0.36; 95\% confidence interval [CI], ?0.47 to ?0.24; z = ?6.18; P {\textless} 0.001) and found a small effect on subsequent decisions (odds ratio = 1.32; 95\% CI, 1.10?1.59; z = 2.99; P = 0.003). The perceived probability fully mediated the effect of the ratio format on decision. Age, gender, and education did not moderate the 1-in-X effect on decision. We argue that a high prevalence of 1-in-X ratios in medical communication makes these small changes clinically relevant. Therefore, to communicate information accurately, 1-in-X ratios should not be used or at least used cautiously in medical communication.},

	abstract = {Background
Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects more than 33 million individuals worldwide and increases risks of stroke, heart failure, and death. The CHARGE-AF risk score was developed to predict incident AF in three American cohorts and it was validated in two European cohorts. The CHA2DS2-VASc risk score was derived to predict risk of stroke, peripheral embolism, and pulmonary embolism in individuals with AF, but it has been increasingly used for AF risk prediction. We compared CHARGE-AF risk score versus CHA2DS2-VASc risk score for incident AF risk in a community-based cohort.

Methods and Results
We studied Framingham Heart Study participants aged 46 to 94 years without prevalent AF and with complete covariates. We predicted AF risk using Fine-Gray proportional sub-distribution hazards regression. We used the Wald χ2 statistic for model fit, C-statistic for discrimination, and Hosmer-Lemeshow (HL) χ2 statistic for calibration. We included 9722 observations (mean age 63.9 ± 10.6 years, 56\% women) from 4548 unique individuals: 752 (16.5\%) developed incident AF and 793 (17.4\%) died. The mean CHARGE-AF score was 12.0 ± 1.2 and the sub-distribution hazard ratio (sHR) for AF per unit increment was 2.15 (95\% CI, 99–131\%; P {\textless} .0001). The mean CHA2DS2-VASc score was 2.0 ± 1.5 and the sHR for AF per unit increment was 1.43 (95\% CI, 37\%-51\%; P {\textless} .0001). The CHARGE-AF model had better fit than CHA2DS2-VASc (Wald χ2 = 403 vs 209, both with 1 df), improved discrimination (C-statistic = 0.75, 95\% CI, 0.73–0.76 vs C-statistic = 0.71, 95\% CI, 0.69–0.73), and better calibration (HL χ2 = 5.6, P = .69 vs HL χ2 = 28.5, P {\textless} .0001).

Conclusion
The CHARGE-AF risk score performed better than the CHA2DS2-VASc risk score at predicting AF in a community-based cohort.},

Vaccination intentions were lower for the Uncertainty and Normalized-Uncertainty groups compared to the No-Uncertainty group, consistent with ambiguity aversion; Uncertainty and Normalized-Uncertainty groups did not differ. Ambiguity-averse responses were moderated by health literacy and mediated by perceptions of vaccine effectiveness, VPD likelihood, and VPD severity.

If so, the metaphor may hurt prevention intentions involving self-limitation. Participants read messages with minute wording variations that established different metaphoric frames. Results show that metaphorically framing cancer as an enemy lessens the conceptual accessibility of (Study 1) and intention for self-limiting prevention behaviors while not increasing intention for monitoring and treatment behaviors (Studies 2 and 3). Framing self-limiting prevention behaviors in terms of fighting an enemy increases their appeal, illustrating the benefits of metaphor matching (Study 3).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The factors that drive overtreatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) are not well understood, but it has been proposed that the use of the “GERD” disease label could perpetuate use of medication in otherwise healthy infants.
METHODS: To determine if use of the disease label GERD influences parents’ perceived need to medicate an infant, we surveyed parents in a general pediatric clinic. Parents were given a hypothetical clinical scenario describing an infant who cries and spits up excessively but is otherwise healthy. Using a 2 × 2 factorial design, parents were randomized to receive a scenario in which the doctor either gave a diagnosis of GERD or did not provide a disease label; additionally, half of parents were told that existing medications are probably ineffective, whereas the rest were not given any effectiveness information. We measured parent interest in medication, perception of illness severity, and appreciation of medication offer.
RESULTS: Parents who received a GERD diagnosis were interested in medicating their infant, even when they were told that the medications are likely ineffective. However, parents not given a disease label were interested in medication only when medication effectiveness was not discussed (and hence likely assumed).
CONCLUSIONS: Labeling an otherwise healthy infant as having a “disease” increased parents’ interest in medicating their infant when they were told that medications are ineffective. These findings suggest that use of disease labels may promote overtreatment by causing people to believe that ineffective medications are both useful and necessary.},

Results indicated that the numerical positive-framed message increased condom use among young adults who did not receive the intervention, whereas the numerical negative-framed message did not. Attitudes toward condom use along with changes in intentions to use condoms mediated this framing effect. In contrast, the positive-framed and negative-framed messages were equally and highly effective for promoting condom use when the messages were presented visually or when young adults received the STD educational intervention before reading the message, suggesting that the simple brochures featuring visual aids were as effective in changing attitudes and behavioral intentions as the extensive intervention. These findings add to a growing body of evidence detailing the mechanisms that allow well-constructed visual aids to be among the most effective, transparent, memorable, and ethically desirable means of risk communication.

Predictors of these problems and also implications for clinical practice will be mentioned. Having a child with CHD can be very stressful for parents, who have to face overwhelming emotions and also extra physical, financial, and other practical challenges. Parental distress has been reported in 30–80\% of parents and appears not to be related to severity of CHD. Parental mental health, parenting, the parent–child relationship, and parental quality of life can all be affected. Parents, and especially mothers, are at risk of psychological distress, anxiety, depression, somatization, hopelessness, and posttraumatic stress symptoms, which in turn may influence mother’s responsiveness. In the long term, the majority of parents adapt successfully to living with a child with CHD, but approximately 40\% report a need for psychosocial care. These families may be helped by early psychosocial interventions to alleviate stress and reduce children’s emotional and behavioral problems. A holistic approach to early psychosocial interventions should aim at improving coping and enhance parenting. During routine medical checkups, medical professionals should ask about parental stress, family functioning, and psychosocial functioning of the child and, when needed, adequate psychosocial care should be provided.},

Participants who scored higher on “ability” EI were less susceptible to scams.

We find that differences in the age structure of the population and the age-specific prevalence of COVID-19 explain nearly 90\% of the geographical variation in population IFR.

Human overuse of antibiotics is a contributing factor and major behaviour change around antibiotic consumption is needed, but several challenges exist in communicating antibiotic resistance to the public. In 2018 the UK Government relaunched a national television advertisement as part of the ‘Keep Antibiotics Working’ campaign which aimed to raise awareness of antibiotic resistance and reduce public demand for antibiotics. This study evaluates what role the framing of antibiotic resistance in the advertisement played in increasing public understanding of antibiotic resistance and motivating behaviour change. The study is grounded in behaviour change and health communication theory from the field of Communication for Development, and health and social psychology theory, reflecting the need for multidisciplinary approaches to addressing antibiotic resistance. A textual analysis identified how the issue was framed in the advertisement and surveys and interviews were conducted with members of the target audience groups to analyse what effect the advertisement had on their understanding of, and attitude towards antibiotic resistance.},

In correlational Study 1, we showed a positive relationship between media exposure in the United Kingdom (UK) and in Poland, and prejudice to four foreign nationalities. Study 2 showed that negative aﬀect toward Italians (i.e., a nation struggling with the most severe COVID-19 outbreak at the time of the study) was indirectly predicted by exposure to news about coronavirus through the increase in anxiety, but this eﬀect was not observed when a generalized measure of prejudice was considered. Overall, our studies revealed that prejudice and anxiety are sensitive to the current epidemiological situation, and our ﬁndings suggest that the outbreak of COVID-19 may translate into severe social consequences and increased psychological distancing to nations most aﬀected by the pandemic.},

Greater perceptions of social endorsement of the guidelines, positive attitudes related to the guidelines, and stronger intentions to follow the guidelines were associated with greater adherence.

	abstract = {Moral dilemma judgements frequently involve decisions where moral norms and the greater good are in conflict. The current preregistered study tested the effect of the steroid hormone testosterone on moral dilemma judgements using a double-blind administration of testosterone or placebo. Counter to predictions, testosterone administration led to increased inaction in moral dilemmas where harmful actions prohibited by moral norms increase overall well-being. Using a mathematical model to disentangle sensitivity to consequences, sensitivity to moral norms and general preference for inaction versus action, analyses further revealed that testosterone administration influenced judgements by increasing sensitivity to moral norms. Exploratory analyses suggested the opposite pattern for endogenous testosterone measured at baseline, in that higher levels of endogenous testosterone were associated with lower sensitivity to moral norms. The results indicate that the role of testosterone in moral judgements is more complex than suggested by previous findings.},

	abstract = {Despite the popularity of the Ancient Greek maxim ‘know thyself’, the importance of self-insight for adjustment, or effective psychological functioning, remains unclear. Here we examined four perspectives about how cognitive and emotional abilities and self-views about these abilities relate to adjustment. We administered tests of cognitive and emotional abilities and assessed self-views about these abilities. Participants then completed daily diaries for a week to report multiple self-reported indicators of adjustment. We analysed data using polynomial regression and response surface analysis. We found no support for benefits of self-insight. The conditions to infer support for linear or curvilinear associations between abilities or self-views about these abilities and adjustment were also not met. The findings suggest that giving employees and students feedback about their cognitive and emotional abilities in organizations and in schools may not enhance their adjustment. We discuss the limitations of our study and offer suggestions for future research.},

	abstract = {Background Monitoring the reasons why a considerable number of people do not receive recommended vaccinations allows identification of important trends over time, and designing and evaluating strategies to address vaccine hesitancy and increase vaccine uptake. Existing validated measures assessing vaccine hesitancy focus primarily on confidence in vaccines and the system that delivers them. However, empirical and theoretical work has stated that complacency (not perceiving diseases as high risk), constraints (structural and psychological barriers), calculation (engagement in extensive information searching), and aspects pertaining to collective responsibility (willingness to protect others) also play a role in explaining vaccination behavior. The objective was therefore to develop a validated measure of these 5C psychological antecedents of vaccination. Methods and findings Three cross-sectional studies were conducted. Study 1 uses factor analysis to develop an initial scale and assesses the sub-scales’ convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity (N = 1,445, two German convenience-samples). In Study 2, a sample representative regarding age and gender for the German population (N = 1,003) completed the measure for vaccination in general and for specific vaccinations to assess the potential need for a vaccine-specific wording of items. Study 3 compared the novel scale’s performance with six existing measures of vaccine hesitancy (N = 350, US convenience-sample). As an outcome, a long (15-item) and short (5-item) 5C scale were developed as reliable and valid indicators of confidence, complacency, constraints, calculation, and collective responsibility. The 5C sub-scales correlated with relevant psychological concepts, such as attitude (confidence), perceived personal health status and invulnerability (complacency), self-control (constraints), preference for deliberation (calculation), and communal orientation (collective responsibility), among others. The new scale provided similar results when formulated in a general vs. vaccine-specific way (Study 2). In a comparison of seven measures the 5C scale was constantly among the scales that explained the highest amounts of variance in analyses predicting single vaccinations (between 20\% and 40\%; Study 3). The present studies are limited to the concurrent validity of the scales. Conclusions The 5C scale provides a novel tool to monitor psychological antecedents of vaccination and facilitates diagnosis, intervention design and evaluation. Its short version is suitable for field settings and regular global monitoring of relevant antecedents of vaccination.},

	abstract = {Background
Knowledge of determinants that influence antibiotic prescription behaviour (APB) is essential for the successful implementation of antimicrobial stewardship interventions. The theory of planned behaviour (TPB) is an established model that describes how cognitions drive human behaviour.
Objectives
The objective of this study was to identify the sociocultural and behavioural determinants that affect APB and to construct a TPB framework of behavioural intent.
Methods
The following online databases were searched: PubMed, Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and Central. Studies published between July 2010 and July 2017 in European countries, the United States, Canada, New Zealand or Australia were included if they identified one or more determinants of physicians' APB. A systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Based on the TPB, determinants were categorized in behavioural, normative and control beliefs, thus shaping a conceptual framework for APB.
Results
Nine studies were eligible for inclusion, and 16 determinants were identified. Determinants relating to fear of adverse outcome (5/9), tolerance of risk and uncertainty (5/9), hierarchy (6/9), and determinants concerning normative beliefs—particularly social team dynamics (6/9)—were most frequently reported. Beliefs about antimicrobial resistance and potential negative consequences of antibiotic use were rarely mentioned.
Conclusions
Behavioural, normative and control beliefs are all relevant in APB. There is a need for quantitative studies to assess the weight of the individual determinants to be able to efficiently design and implement future stewardship interventions. The constructed framework enables a comprehensive approach towards understanding and altering APB.},

	abstract = {Background: 
        Overuse of antibiotics leads to antibiotic resistance, costing \$35 billion and causing approximately 23,000 deaths in the United States annually. Antibiotic stewardship is important in urgent care centers to prevent antibiotic resistance.
        Local problem: 
        Providers prescribed antibiotics to 80\% of patients with viral conditions at this urgent care center. The aim of this quality improvement (QI) project was to improve right care for patients of 65 years and younger with upper respiratory infections and/or head, ears, nose, or throat viral illnesses presenting to urgent care from 36.2\% to 80\% within 90 days.
        Methods: 
        Four rapid Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles were performed every two weeks. Four concurrent focus areas were used for team and patient engagement, antibiotic prescribing, and tracking right care.
        Interventions: 
        There were four core interventions. These included biweekly team meetings, a shared decision aid (SDA), an antibiotic prescribing 5 Ds tool, and a case management log.
        Results: 
        Use of the SDA improved patient engagement from 33\% to 93\%. The 5 Ds tool improved proper prescribing from 20\% to 95\%. Pediatric acute otitis media had the greatest improvement, with the proper diagnosis and the use of watchful waiting, delaying the filling of an antibiotic prescription.
        Conclusion: 
        Antibiotic stewardship and standardization of prescribing were improved in urgent care with the use of the 5 Ds tool. This QI project can be replicated for use in urgent care centers for compliance with the Joint Commission standards required.},

	abstract = {Getting the message across about the dangers of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and how to prevent it is a global priority. This article discusses the role of information design in the effective communication of information about AMR, and suggests that the design process—user input, iteration and consideration of circumstances of use—is key to successful communication. To illustrate this, using material from the Otto and Marie Neurath Isotype Collection at the University of Reading, this article considers the work of Otto and Marie Neurath who developed the Isotype system for visual education in the 1920s. They collaborated with scientists, writers and illustrators to ensure that messages were both accurate and relevant for their intended audiences, so that people could make their own decisions based on factual explanation. Their use of pictograms and schematic illustrations, consistent use of colours to represent meaning, and carefully considered relationships between text and image provided a distinctive visual ‘look and feel’. The charts designed by the Neuraths to educate people about health included a series made in the 1930s for the US National Tuberculosis Association to explain the dangers of, and how to prevent TB. This article reviews how these charts were designed, including the designated role of the ‘transformer’ who worked to ensure that scientific facts were presented in an understandable form. The way of working and the verbal and graphic characteristics of the charts deserve serious consideration for effective communication of information about AMR today. Particularly relevant are the use of schematic images using scale and simplification to attract attention, the use of story-telling to engage people, not overwhelming readers with too much information, and using straightforward language. The article asserts that cross-disciplinary working is key to successful explanation about the dangers of AMR. It illustrates this with reference to a research project, influenced by the Isotype approach to public health communication, that brings together academics and practitioners in information design, architecture, ergonomics and human factors, and pharmacy in communicating information about AMR to people using community pharmacies.},

	abstract = {Objectives
To explore current practices and decision-making regarding antimicrobial prescribing among Emergency Department (ED) clinical providers.

Methods
We conducted a survey of ED providers recruited from eight sites in three cities. Using purposeful sampling, we then recruited 21 providers for in-depth interviews. Additionally, we observed ten patient-provider interactions at one of the ED sites. SAS 9.3 was used for descriptive and predictive statistics. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and analyzed using a thematic, constructivist approach with consensus coding using NVivo 10.0. Field and interview notes collected during the observational study were aligned with themes identified through individual interviews.

Results
Of 150 survey respondents, 76\% agreed or strongly agreed antibiotics are overused in the ED, while half believed they personally did not overprescribe. Eighty nine percent used a smartphone or tablet in the ED for antibiotic prescribing decisions. Several significant differences were found between attending and resident physicians. Interview analysis identified 42 codes aggregated into the following themes: (1) resource and environmental factors that affect care; (2) access to and quality of care received outside of the ED consult; (3) patient-provider relationships; (4) clinical inertia; and (5) local knowledge generation. The observational study revealed limited patient understanding of antibiotic use. Providers relied heavily upon diagnostics and provided limited education to patients. Most patients denied a priori expectations of being prescribed antibiotics.

Conclusions
Patient, provider, and healthcare system factors should be considered when designing interventions to improve antimicrobial stewardship in the ED setting.},

	abstract = {Aim Little is known about the determinants of antimicrobial prescribing behaviour (APB), how they vary between hospital prescribers or the mechanism by which interventions are effective. Yet, interventions based on a sound theoretical understanding of APB are more likely to be successful in changing outcomes. This study sought to quantify the potential determinants of APB among hospital doctors in south-west England. Methods This multicentre, quantitative study employed a closed answer questionnaire to garner hospital doctors' views on factors influencing their APB. Underlying constructs within the data were identified using exploratory factor analysis and subsequent pairwise comparisons assessed for variance between groups of prescribers. Results The questionnaire was completed by 301 doctors across four centres (response rate ≥ 74\%) and three key factors were identified: autonomy, guidelines adherence and antibiotic awareness. The internal consistency for the questionnaire scale and for each factor subscale was good (α ≥ 0.7). Subgroup analysis identified significant differences between groups of prescribers: autonomy scores increased with grade until at the specialist trainee level (P ≤ 0.009), foundation doctors scored higher for guidelines adherence than consultants (P = 0.004) and specialist trainees (P = 0.003) and United Kingdom trained doctors scored higher than those trained abroad for antibiotic awareness (P {\textless} 0.0005). Scores did not vary significantly between doctors from different centres. Conclusion Autonomy, guidelines adherence and antibiotic awareness were identified as important factors relevant to APB, which vary with experience and training. A theoretical framework is offered to facilitate development of more effective, tailored interventions to change APBs.},

	abstract = {It should come as no surprise that the governments and citizenries of many countries show little concern about climate change and its consequences. Behavioral decision research over the last 30 years provides a series of lessons about the importance of affect in perceptions of risk and in decisions to take actions that reduce or manage perceived risks. Evidence from a range of domains suggests that worry drives risk management decisions. When people fail to be alarmed about a risk or hazard, they do not take precautions. Recent personal experience strongly influences the evaluation of a risky option. Low-probability events generate less concern than their probability warrants on average, but more concern than they deserve in those rare instances when they do occur. Personal experience with noticeable and serious consequences of global warming is still rare in many regions of the world. When people base their decisions on statistical descriptions about a hazard provided by others, characteristics of the hazard identified as psychological risk dimensions predict differences in alarm or worry across different classes of risk. The time-delayed, abstract, and often statistical nature of the risks of global warming does not evoke strong visceral reactions. These results suggest that we should find ways to evoke visceral reactions towards the risk of global warming, perhaps by simulations of its concrete future consequences for people's home or other regions they visit or value. Increased concern about global warming needs to solicited carefully, however, to prevent a decrease in concern about other relevant risks. The generation of worry or concern about global warming may be a necessary but not sufficient condition for desirable or appropriate protective or mitigating behavior on part of the general public.},

The most important factor is antibiotic overuse. Antibiotics are commonly used in situations in which no antibiotics are indicated. Thirty percent to 50\% of ambulatory antibiotic use may be inappropriate. The duration of indicated antibiotic use is often excessive, which leads to more side effects. All antibiotic use can result in adverse reactions, and a fraction of these will be dutifully recorded as an allergy in the electronic health record (EHR). Most EHRs are not well structured to accurately convey information on expected side effects that have occurred, metabolic or other contraindications, dose-related or situational toxicities, personal preferences, clinically significant immunologically mediated hypersensitivity, and other reasons a particular patient may not want or should not be given a specific drug or type of drug in the future. As populations age, their accumulated baggage of reported antibiotic allergies increase. Suspected antibiotic allergy is rarely confirmed with appropriate testing or rechallenge. Patients then receive suboptimal antibiotic therapy and experience more side effects, treatment failures, and serious antibiotic-resistant infections. Reporting an antibiotic allergy in the EHR is nominally done to improve patient safety, but unfortunately, this is often not the actual result.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Conclusion{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Audit and feedback, to help ensure adherence to Choosing Wisely recommendations and good antibiotic stewardship practices, can help reduce inappropriate antibiotic use.

	abstract = {Background: The negative effect of the penicillin allergy label on antibiotic use and patient outcomes has brought to light the need for thorough penicillin allergy assessments and heightened practitioner education.
Objective: To evaluate practitioner knowledge of penicillin allergy and the clinical approach to the patients with penicillin allergy.
Methods: An electronic survey was distributed to attending physicians, residents, pharmacists, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants practicing adult inpatient medicine at 2 community-based teaching hospitals from February to April 2016.
Results: A total of 276 (39\%) of 716 practitioners completed surveys were analyzed. Most respondents were attending physicians (45\%) with more than 10 years of experience (53\%). Approximately half of the respondents indicated that they were unfamiliar with the rate of cross-reactivity between penicillin and cephalosporin (46\%), carbapenem (42\%), and monobactam (48\%) antibiotics. When evaluating the role of penicillin skin testing and temporary induction of drug tolerance in the case vignettes, only 41\% and 19\% of respondents appropriately considered these options as the leading antibiotic management plan, respectively. Despite acknowledging the need for allergy/immunology consultation in clinical scenarios, 86\% of respondents indicated that they never consult an allergist or immunologist or do so only once per year. Overall, pharmacists had a better understanding of the natural history of penicillin allergy and antibiotic cross-reactivity (P {\textless} .05).
Conclusion: There is an overall limited understanding of the management of patients with a history of penicillin allergy in the hospital setting, where collaborative efforts between allergy and nonallergy health care practitioners are sparse. The expansion of a multidisciplinary approach may optimize antimicrobial prescribing in this subset of patients.},

	doi = {10.1001/jamainternmed.2013.14191},
	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: "Nudges" that influence decision making through subtle cognitive mechanisms have been shown to be highly effective in a wide range of applications, but there have been few experiments to improve clinical practice.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the use of a behavioral "nudge" based on the principle of public commitment in encouraging the judicious use of antibiotics for acute respiratory infections (ARIs).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized clinical trial in 5 outpatient primary care clinics. A total of 954 adults had ARI visits during the study timeframe: 449 patients were treated by clinicians randomized to the posted commitment letter (335 in the baseline period, 114 in the intervention period); 505 patients were treated by clinicians randomized to standard practice control (384 baseline, 121 intervention).
INTERVENTIONS: The intervention consisted of displaying poster-sized commitment letters in examination rooms for 12 weeks. These letters, featuring clinician photographs and signatures, stated their commitment to avoid inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for ARIs.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Antibiotic prescribing rates for antibiotic-inappropriate ARI diagnoses in baseline and intervention periods, adjusted for patient age, sex, and insurance status.
RESULTS: Baseline rates were 43.5\% and 42.8\% for control and poster, respectively. During the intervention period, inappropriate prescribing rates increased to 52.7\% for controls but decreased to 33.7\% in the posted commitment letter condition. Controlling for baseline prescribing rates, we found that the posted commitment letter resulted in a 19.7 absolute percentage reduction in inappropriate antibiotic prescribing rate relative to control (P = .02). There was no evidence of diagnostic coding shift, and rates of appropriate antibiotic prescriptions did not diminish over time.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Displaying poster-sized commitment letters in examination rooms decreased inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for ARIs. The effect of this simple, low-cost intervention is comparable in magnitude to costlier, more intensive quality-improvement efforts.

	abstract = {Background: Sweden enjoys a favourable situation with regard to antimicrobial resistance. However, healthcare costs are expected to increase exponentially, along with increased morbidity and mortality, due to the emergence of resistant bacterial strains. Our aim was to design an antimicrobial stewardship programme suitable for Scandinavian settings.Methods: A quasi-experimental pre-post study was conducted in a Swedish paediatric emergency department, evaluating adherence to national guidelines for acute otitis media and acute tonsillitis. The programme consisted of educational outreach, decision support, feedback, and a minor reward upon reaching a pre-defined adherence rate.Results: The largest impact, significant for both diagnoses, was on the practice of refraining from antibiotic use when recommended. The other variables evaluated showed no significant improvement for either condition; however, in most cases, pre-interventional adherence was already high.Conclusions: This relatively easily implementable ASP intervention showed a significant effect on correctly refraining from the use of antibiotics. Previous interventions in Scandinavia either failed to accomplish this or have been more logistically difficult. The combination of education, decision support, email-based feedback and a minor reward, offers an alternative. Future research will be needed to assess whether the result is sustainable, as well as to identify additional barriers to the judicious use of antibiotics not addressed in this study.},
