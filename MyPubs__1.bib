	abstract = {Background/study context: Recent studies have shown that young adults better remember factual information they are curious about. It is not entirely clear, however, whether this eﬀect is retained during aging. Here, the authors investigated curiosity-driven memory beneﬁts in young and elderly individuals.
Methods: In two experiments, young (age range 18–26) and older (age range 65–89) adults read trivia questions and rated their curiosity to ﬁnd out the answer. They also attended to task-irrelevant faces presented between the trivia question and the answer. The authors then administered a surprise memory test to assess recall accuracy for trivia answers and recognition memory performance for the incidentally learned faces.
Results: In both young and elderly adults, recall performance was higher for answers to questions that elicited high levels of curiosity. In Experiment 1, the authors also found that faces presented in temporal proximity to curiosity-eliciting trivia questions were better recognized, indicating that the beneﬁcial eﬀects of curiosity extended to the encoding of task-irrelevant material.
Conclusions: These ﬁndings show that elderly individuals beneﬁt from the memory-enhancing eﬀects of curiosity. This may lead to the implementation of learning strategies that target and stimulate curiosity in aging.},

	abstract = {From their impacts to potential threats, privacy and misinformation are a recurring top news story. Social media platforms (e.g. Facebook) and information retrieval (IR) systems (e.g. Google), are now in the public spotlight to address these issues. Our research investigates an approach, known as Nudging, applied to the domain of IR, as a potential means to minimize impacts and threats surrounding both matters. We perform our study in the space of health search for two reasons. First, encounters with misinformation in this space have potentially grave outcomes. Second, there are many potential threats to personal privacy as a result of the data collected during a search task. Adopting methods and a corpus from previous work as the foundation, our study asked users to determine the effectiveness of a treatment for 10 medical conditions. Users performed the tasks on 4 variants of a search engine results page (SERP) and a control, with 3 of the SERPS being a Nudge (re-ranking, filtering and a visual cue) intended to reduce impacts to privacy. The aim of our work is to determine the Nudge that is least impactful to good decision making while simultaneously increasing privacy protection. We find privacy impacts are reduced for all 3 approaches, however our results indicate that filtering is an approach that should be ruled out, as harmful decisions increase significantly and correct decisions decrease significantly. Our findings suggest that re-ranking is the most promising approach.},

Our research investigates a search system with privacy warning labels, an approach inspired by decision making research on food nutrition labels. This approach is designed to alert users to potential privacy threats in their search for information as one possible avenue to address privacy concerns. Our primary goal was to understand the extent to which attitudes towards privacy are linked to behaviors that protect privacy. In the present study participants were given a set of fact based decision tasks from the domain of health search. Participants were rotated through variations of search engine results pages (SERPs) of which they encountered a SERP with a privacy warning light system and completed a survey which captured attitudes towards privacy, behaviors to protect privacy, and other demographic information. In addition to the comparison of interactive search behaviors of a privacy warning SERP with a control SERP, we compared self reported privacy measures with interactive search behaviors. Participants reported strong concerns around privacy of health information while simultaneously placing high importance on the correctness of this information. Analysis of our interactive experiment and self report privacy measures indicate that 1) choice of privacy protective browsers has a significant link to privacy attitudes and privacy protective behaviors in a SERP and 2) there are no significant links between reported concerns towards privacy and recorded behavior in an information retrieval system with warnings that enable users to protect their privacy.},

	abstract = {Loss of privacy and encounters with misinformation are two challenges individuals are likely to encounter in their search for information on the web. These challenges have potential negative impacts, especially in search domains such as health search. Existing information retrieval (IR) systems offer users little (if any) guidance as to how to reduce the likelihood of such negative impacts. The sum of these problems provides motivation for experiments to identify elements of existing IR environments that might provide low-cost options to the user for improved search outcomes. An online user study (N = 90) was performed allowing users to visit search results for 10 medical search tasks adapted from previous research. Analysis was performed on all search results visited in the experiment, with a total of 523 unique web pages collectively visited, with additional analysis performed on a set of 10,000 popular websites. The analysis suggests that the best strategy for users with the goal of protecting their privacy and simultaneously finding more accurate information for their medical search tasks, is to visit websites with .org and .gov in the URL. There is some evidence that HTTP is a useful predictor as well. Existing literature is limited with respect to utilization of these features and thus the findings, along with the annotations, are a key contribution for future research, for which possible directions are provided.},

We expected that information provision about illnesses and antibiotics would reduce but not eliminate inappropriate preferences for antibiotics and that cognitive biases could explain why some people resist the effect of information provision. In 2 experiments, participants (n₁ = 424; n₂ = 434) either received incomplete information (about the viral etiology of their infection) or complete information (about viral etiology and the ineffectiveness and harms of taking antibiotics), before deciding to rest or take antibiotics. Those in the complete information conditions responded to items on 4 biases: action bias, social norm, source discrediting, and information neglect. In 2 follow-up experiments (n₁ = 150; n₂ = 732), we aimed to counteract the action bias by reframing the perception of the resting option as an action. Complete information provision reduced but did not eliminate inappropriate preferences for antibiotics. Around 10\% of people wanted antibiotics even when informed they are harmful and offer no benefit and even when the alternative option (i.e., rest) was framed as an active treatment option. Results suggest an action bias underpins this preference but appears challenging to counteract. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

We compare findings with recent studies of retracted papers in economics, and business and management, to profile practices that are likely to be problematic in cognate social science disciplines. In psychology, the principal reason for retraction was data fabrication. Retractions took longer to make, and generally were from higher ranked and more prestigious journals, than in the two cognate disciplines. We recommend that journal editors should be more forthcoming in the reasons they provide for article retractions. We also recommend that the discipline of psychology gives a greater priority to the publication of replication studies; initiates a debate about how to respond to failed replications; adopts a more critical attitude to the importance of attaining statistical significance; discourages p-hacking and Hypothesizing After Results are Known (HARKing); assesses the long-term effects of pre-registering research; and supports stronger procedures to attest to the authenticity of data in research papers. Our contribution locates these issues in the context of a growing crisis of confidence in the value of social science research. We also challenge individual researchers to reassert the primacy of disinterested academic inquiry above pressures that can lead to an erosion of scholarly integrity.},

	abstract = {Objectives To reduce overprescribing, health campaigns urge physicians to provide people with information regarding appropriate antibiotic use and encourage the public to trust their physicians’ prescribing decisions. We test (1) whether providing individuals with complete information about the viral aetiology of an illness and the ineffectiveness of antibiotics will reduce inappropriate antibiotic expectations, (2) whether individuals with greater trust in their physician will have lower expectations, and (3) whether individuals with greater trust in their physician will benefit more from the complete information provision and have lower expectations. Design Experiment 1 features a between-subjects design (information provision: baseline vs. complete information) with a general measure of participants’ trust in their physician. Experiment 2 features a 2 (physician trustworthiness: low vs. high) × 2 (information provision: baseline vs. complete information) between-subjects design. Methods In Experiment 1, participants (n = 366) reported their trust in their physician, read a vignette describing a hypothetical consultation with a physician for a viral cold and then expressed their expectations for antibiotics. In Experiment 2, participants (n = 380) read a vignette of a consultation with a physician for a viral ear infection then expressed their expectations for antibiotics. Results In both experiments, the provision of complete information significantly reduced inappropriate expectations for antibiotics. Greater trust in physicians was associated with higher antibiotic expectations in Experiment 1, but lower expectations in Experiment 2. In both experiments, trust in physicians appeared to facilitate the effect of information provision, but this effect was weak and inconsistent. Conclusion Providing information about viral aetiology and the ineffectiveness and side effects of antibiotics reduces inappropriate antibiotic expectations. Further research into the effect of trust in physicians as a moderator of the effect information provision is required, particularly given the recent increase in trust-based antibiotic campaigns. Statement of contribution What is already known Inappropriate expectations for antibiotics encourage overprescribing in primary care. To reduce inappropriate expectations, interventions often aim to educate people about antibiotics and encourage them to trust their physician. What does this study add Causal evidence that clinical information provision reduces but does not eliminate inappropriate antibiotic expectations. We find that increased trust in physicians is not always associated with lower expectations for antibiotics. Although increased trust seemed to boost the effect of information provision, this effect was weak and inconsistent.},

We conducted a correlational study (Study 1), in which we examined the role of antibiotic knowledge and beliefs and an experiment (Study 2) in which we assessed the causal effect of information provision on antibiotic expectations.

In Study 2, a 2 (viral information: present vs. absent) × 2 (antibiotic information: present vs. absent) experimental between-subjects design, information about antibiotic efficacy significantly reduced expectations for antibiotics, but viral aetiology information did not.

	doi = {10.2196/27832},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Communicating scientific uncertainty about public health threats such as COVID-19 is an ethically desirable task endorsed by expert guidelines on crisis communication. However, the communication of scientific uncertainty is challenging because of its potential to promote ambiguity aversion-a well-described syndrome of negative psychological responses consisting of heightened risk perceptions, emotional distress, and decision avoidance. Communication strategies that can inform the public about scientific uncertainty while mitigating ambiguity aversion are a critical unmet need.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate whether an "uncertainty-normalizing" communication strategy-aimed at reinforcing the expected nature of scientific uncertainty about the COVID-19 pandemic-can reduce ambiguity aversion, and to compare its effectiveness to conventional public communication strategies aimed at promoting hope and prosocial values.
METHODS: In an online factorial experiment conducted from May to June 2020, a national sample of 1497 US adults read one of five versions of an informational message describing the nature, transmission, prevention, and treatment of COVID-19; the versions varied in level of expressed scientific uncertainty and supplemental focus (ie, uncertainty-normalizing, hope-promoting, and prosocial). Participants then completed measures of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral manifestations of ambiguity aversion (ie, perceived likelihood of getting COVID-19, COVID-19 worry, and intentions for COVID-19 risk-reducing behaviors and vaccination). Analyses assessed (1) the extent to which communicating uncertainty produced ambiguity-averse psychological responses; (2) the comparative effectiveness of uncertainty-normalizing, hope-promoting, and prosocial communication strategies in reducing ambiguity-averse responses; and (3) potential moderators of the effects of alternative uncertainty communication strategies.
RESULTS: The communication of scientific uncertainty about the COVID-19 pandemic increased perceived likelihood of getting COVID-19 and worry about COVID-19, consistent with ambiguity aversion. However, it did not affect intentions for risk-reducing behaviors or vaccination. The uncertainty-normalizing strategy reduced these aversive effects of communicating scientific uncertainty, resulting in levels of both perceived likelihood of getting COVID-19 and worry about COVID-19 that did not differ from the control message that did not communicate uncertainty. In contrast, the hope-promoting and prosocial strategies did not decrease ambiguity-averse responses to scientific uncertainty. Age and political affiliation, respectively, moderated the effects of uncertainty communication strategies on intentions for COVID-19 risk-reducing behaviors and worry about COVID-19.
CONCLUSIONS: Communicating scientific uncertainty about the COVID-19 pandemic produces ambiguity-averse cognitive and emotional, but not behavioral, responses among the general public, and an uncertainty-normalizing communication strategy reduces these responses. Normalizing uncertainty may be an effective strategy for mitigating ambiguity aversion in crisis communication efforts. More research is needed to test uncertainty-normalizing communication strategies and to elucidate the factors that moderate their effectiveness.},

	abstract = {Background. To effectively promote vaccine uptake, it is important to understand which people are most and least inclined to be vaccinated and why. Purpose. To identify predictors of COVID–19 vaccine uptake and reasons for non–vaccination. Design. A longitudinal English–language survey study. Setting. Online in December–2020, January–2021, and March–2021. Participants. 930 US respondents (63\% Veterans). Measurements. Surveys included questions about respondents' behaviors, well–being, healthcare experiences, and attitudes regarding the pandemic. Results. The proportion of respondents who received ≥1–dose of a COVID–19 vaccine increased from 18\% in January to 67\% in March. Older age predicted vaccine uptake in January (OR=2.02[95\%CI=1.14–3.78], p{\textless}.001) and March (10.92[6.76–18.05], p{\textless}.001). In January, additional predictors of vaccine uptake were higher numeracy (1.48[1.20–1.86], p{\textless}.001), COVID–19 risk perceptions (1.35[1.03–1.78], p=.029), and believing it is important that adults get the COVID–19 vaccine (1.66[1.05–2.66], p=.033). In March, additional predictors of vaccine uptake were believing it is important that adults get the COVID–19 vaccine (1.63[1.15–2.34], p=.006), previous (January) COVID–19 vaccine intentions (1.37[1.10–1.72], p=.006), and belief in science (0.84[0.72–0.99], p=.041). Concerns about side effects and the vaccine development process were the most common reasons for non–vaccination. Unvaccinated respondents with no interest in getting a COVID–19 vaccine were younger (0.27[0.09–0.77], p=.016), held negative views about COVID–19 vaccines for adults (0.15[0.08–0.26], p{\textless}.001), had lower trust in healthcare (0.59[0.36–0.95], p=.032), and preferred to watch and wait in clinically ambiguous medical situations (0.66[0.48–0.89], p=.007). Limitations. Reliance on the accuracy and consistency of self–reported data. Conclusion. These findings offer important insights regarding key predictors of vaccine uptake during the early stages of the COVID–19 vaccine rollout in the US, which can help guide health communications and public outreach. Evidence that attitudes and intentions towards COVID–19 vaccines are important predictors of uptake provides validation for studies which have used these measures and reinforces the need to develop effective strategies for addressing concerns about vaccine safety and development which continue to be at the forefront of vaccine hesitancy.},

	abstract = {Objectives
Concerns have been raised that mass-vaccination campaigns might lead to reduced engagement with other recommended health behaviors. We assessed self-reported behaviors and risk perceptions following the COVID-19 vaccine rollout in the US.
Study design
Between December-2, 2020 and March-23 2021 we conducted three online survey studies with US adult respondents.
Methods
Respondents self-reported their COVID-19 vaccination status, their frequency of engaging in risk-increasing behaviors and wearing a mask when in public places., and their COVID-19 risk perceptions (i.e., perceived likelihood of getting COVID-19 and of being hospitalized if they got COVID-19).
Results
Our analytical sample included 832 respondents who had completed the first and final surveys and had received either 0 or 2 doses of a COVID-19 vaccine. Most respondents were non-Hispanic White (75\%), male (77\%) and US Veterans (64\%), with the median age between 55 and 74 years. Overall, respondents reported frequently wearing masks when in public and rarely engaging in risk-increasing behaviors. Regardless of vaccination status, respondents reported more frequently engaging in risk-increasing behaviors and lower risk perceptions in March-2021 than December-2020. Mask wearing did not change over the study period with vaccinated respondents consistently reporting more frequent mask wearing than unvaccinated respondents.
Conclusions
Taken together, our findings indicate that the COVID-19 vaccine rollout in the US did not result in the rapid abandonment of protective behaviors or dramatic uptake of risk-increasing behaviors. Additional studies are needed to monitor how mass-vaccination might impact public behaviors and risk perceptions as coverage widens.},

	abstract = {Introduction Parents who receive the diagnosis of a life-threatening, complex heart defect in their fetus or neonate face a difficult choice between pursuing termination (for fetal diagnoses), palliative care or complex surgical interventions. Shared decision making (SDM) is recommended in clinical contexts where there is clinical equipoise. SDM can be facilitated by decision aids. The International Patient Decision Aids Standards collaboration recommends the inclusion of values clarification methods (VCMs), yet little evidence exists concerning the incremental impact of VCMs on patient or surrogate decision making. This protocol describes a randomised clinical trial to evaluate the effect of a decision aid (with and without a VCM) on parental mental health and decision making within a clinical encounter.
Methods and analysis Parents who have a fetus or neonate diagnosed with one of six complex congenital heart defects at a single tertiary centre will be recruited. Data collection for the prospective observational control group was conducted September 2018 to December 2020 (N=35) and data collection for two intervention groups is ongoing (began October 2020). At least 100 participants will be randomised 1:1 to two intervention groups (decision aid only vs decision aid with VCM). For the intervention groups, data will be collected at four time points: (1) at diagnosis, (2) postreceipt of decision aid, (3) postdecision and (4) 3 months postdecision. Data collection for the control group was the same, except they did not receive a survey at time 2. Linear mixed effects models will assess differences between study arms in distress (primary outcome), grief and decision quality (secondary outcomes) at 3-month post-treatment decision.
Ethics and dissemination This study was approved by the University of Utah Institutional Review Board. Study findings have and will continue to be presented at national conferences and within scientific research journals.

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has had detrimental impacts on hospitality businesses. Drawing on protection motivation theory (PMT), this study investigated what determined customer hesitation to patronize restaurants and hotels and whether such hesitation underwent changes in the duration of the pandemic. The research model was tested using three sets of survey data collected in December 2020 (n = 826), February 2021 (n = 832) and April 2021 (n = 808). The study found that expected COVID-19 safety precautions, COVID-19 risk avoidance, and demographic factors predicted customers’ hesitation to visit restaurant/hotel. The analysis also showed significant shifts in how expectations about safety precautions, risk avoidance, and demographics affected customers’ visit hesitation over time. These findings provide critical insights to restaurant and hotel managers and destination marketers. To ensure that customers feel safe and confident in visiting hotels and restaurants, managers should implement the recommended safety measures and clearly communicate the implementation of these measures to customers.},

	abstract = {If not appropriately tackled, in 2050, antibiotic resistance will be one of the leading causes of death worldwide, amounting to 10 million deaths every year. Healthcare organizations encourage the judicious use of antibiotics in human medicine to slow antibiotic resistance. In this research, to encourage such behavior change, we proposed and tested a theory explaining why people expect to be treated with antibiotics when they are not needed. This theory combines laypeople’s diagnostic uncertainty (e.g., “Are my symptoms caused by a bacterial illness?”) with subjective values associated with decisions (e.g., “What are the costs of taking antibiotics when not needed?”). Based on this theory, we hypothesized that people would be less likely to expect antibiotics with decreasing layperson’s diagnostic uncertainty and increasing costs of inappropriate antibiotic use. In two preregistered experiments (N = 1,773; from the U.K. general adult population), we found that both types of interventions—reducing diagnostic uncertainty and increasing the saliency of the costs of overuse (to self or to others)—decreased antibiotic expectations and requests in a hypothetical consultation for a viral ear infection (Experiment 1) and cold-like symptoms (Experiment 2) compared with a baseline group. This explanation can help us better understand why people expect antibiotics when they are not needed and how to create effective health communication to reduce antibiotic overuse.},
