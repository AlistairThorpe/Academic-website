abstract: 'Objectives To reduce overprescribing, health campaigns urge physicians
  to provide people with information regarding appropriate antibiotic use and encourage
  the public to trust their physicians’ prescribing decisions. We test (1) whether
  providing individuals with complete information about the viral aetiology of an
  illness and the ineffectiveness of antibiotics will reduce inappropriate antibiotic
  expectations, (2) whether individuals with greater trust in their physician will
  have lower expectations, and (3) whether individuals with greater trust in their
  physician will benefit more from the complete information provision and have lower
  expectations. Design Experiment 1 features a between-subjects design (information
  provision: baseline vs. complete information) with a general measure of participants’
  trust in their physician. Experiment 2 features a 2 (physician trustworthiness:
  low vs. high) × 2 (information provision: baseline vs. complete information) between-subjects
  design. Methods In Experiment 1, participants (n = 366) reported their trust in
  their physician, read a vignette describing a hypothetical consultation with a physician
  for a viral cold and then expressed their expectations for antibiotics. In Experiment
  2, participants (n = 380) read a vignette of a consultation with a physician for
  a viral ear infection then expressed their expectations for antibiotics. Results
  In both experiments, the provision of complete information significantly reduced
  inappropriate expectations for antibiotics. Greater trust in physicians was associated
  with higher antibiotic expectations in Experiment 1, but lower expectations in Experiment
  2. In both experiments, trust in physicians appeared to facilitate the effect of
  information provision, but this effect was weak and inconsistent. Conclusion Providing
  information about viral aetiology and the ineffectiveness and side effects of antibiotics
  reduces inappropriate antibiotic expectations. Further research into the effect
  of trust in physicians as a moderator of the effect information provision is required,
  particularly given the recent increase in trust-based antibiotic campaigns. Statement
  of contribution What is already known Inappropriate expectations for antibiotics
  encourage overprescribing in primary care. To reduce inappropriate expectations,
  interventions often aim to educate people about antibiotics and encourage them to
  trust their physician. What does this study add Causal evidence that clinical information
  provision reduces but does not eliminate inappropriate antibiotic expectations.
  We find that increased trust in physicians is not always associated with lower expectations
  for antibiotics. Although increased trust seemed to boost the effect of information
  provision, this effect was weak and inconsistent.'
