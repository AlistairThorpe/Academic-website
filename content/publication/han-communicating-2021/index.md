abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Communicating scientific uncertainty about public health threats
  such as COVID-19 is an ethically desirable task endorsed by expert guidelines on
  crisis communication. However, the communication of scientific uncertainty is challenging
  because of its potential to promote ambiguity aversion-a well-described syndrome
  of negative psychological responses consisting of heightened risk perceptions, emotional
  distress, and decision avoidance. Communication strategies that can inform the public
  about scientific uncertainty while mitigating ambiguity aversion are a critical
  unmet need. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate whether an \"uncertainty-normalizing\"
  communication strategy-aimed at reinforcing the expected nature of scientific uncertainty
  about the COVID-19 pandemic-can reduce ambiguity aversion, and to compare its effectiveness
  to conventional public communication strategies aimed at promoting hope and prosocial
  values. METHODS: In an online factorial experiment conducted from May to June 2020,
  a national sample of 1497 US adults read one of five versions of an informational
  message describing the nature, transmission, prevention, and treatment of COVID-19;
  the versions varied in level of expressed scientific uncertainty and supplemental
  focus (ie, uncertainty-normalizing, hope-promoting, and prosocial). Participants
  then completed measures of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral manifestations of
  ambiguity aversion (ie, perceived likelihood of getting COVID-19, COVID-19 worry,
  and intentions for COVID-19 risk-reducing behaviors and vaccination). Analyses assessed
  (1) the extent to which communicating uncertainty produced ambiguity-averse psychological
  responses; (2) the comparative effectiveness of uncertainty-normalizing, hope-promoting,
  and prosocial communication strategies in reducing ambiguity-averse responses; and
  (3) potential moderators of the effects of alternative uncertainty communication
  strategies. RESULTS: The communication of scientific uncertainty about the COVID-19
  pandemic increased perceived likelihood of getting COVID-19 and worry about COVID-19,
  consistent with ambiguity aversion. However, it did not affect intentions for risk-reducing
  behaviors or vaccination. The uncertainty-normalizing strategy reduced these aversive
  effects of communicating scientific uncertainty, resulting in levels of both perceived
  likelihood of getting COVID-19 and worry about COVID-19 that did not differ from
  the control message that did not communicate uncertainty. In contrast, the hope-promoting
  and prosocial strategies did not decrease ambiguity-averse responses to scientific
  uncertainty. Age and political affiliation, respectively, moderated the effects
  of uncertainty communication strategies on intentions for COVID-19 risk-reducing
  behaviors and worry about COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Communicating scientific uncertainty
  about the COVID-19 pandemic produces ambiguity-averse cognitive and emotional, but
  not behavioral, responses among the general public, and an uncertainty-normalizing
  communication strategy reduces these responses. Normalizing uncertainty may be an
  effective strategy for mitigating ambiguity aversion in crisis communication efforts.
  More research is needed to test uncertainty-normalizing communication strategies
  and to elucidate the factors that moderate their effectiveness.'
