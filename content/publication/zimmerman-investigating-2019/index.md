abstract: Privacy concerns are becoming a dominant focus in search applications, thus
  there is a growing need to understand implications of efforts to address these concerns.
  Our research investigates a search system with privacy warning labels, an approach
  inspired by decision making research on food nutrition labels. This approach is
  designed to alert users to potential privacy threats in their search for information
  as one possible avenue to address privacy concerns. Our primary goal was to understand
  the extent to which attitudes towards privacy are linked to behaviors that protect
  privacy. In the present study participants were given a set of fact based decision
  tasks from the domain of health search. Participants were rotated through variations
  of search engine results pages (SERPs) of which they encountered a SERP with a privacy
  warning light system and completed a survey which captured attitudes towards privacy,
  behaviors to protect privacy, and other demographic information. In addition to
  the comparison of interactive search behaviors of a privacy warning SERP with a
  control SERP, we compared self reported privacy measures with interactive search
  behaviors. Participants reported strong concerns around privacy of health information
  while simultaneously placing high importance on the correctness of this information.
  Analysis of our interactive experiment and self report privacy measures indicate
  that 1) choice of privacy protective browsers has a significant link to privacy
  attitudes and privacy protective behaviors in a SERP and 2) there are no significant
  links between reported concerns towards privacy and recorded behavior in an information
  retrieval system with warnings that enable users to protect their privacy.
