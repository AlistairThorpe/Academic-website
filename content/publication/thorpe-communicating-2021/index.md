abstract: 'Purpose Beliefs that the risks from the vaccine outweigh the risks from
  getting COVID-19 and concerns that the vaccine development process was rushed and
  lacking rigor have been identified as important drivers of hesitancy and refusal
  to get a COVID-19 vaccine. We tested whether messages designed to address these
  beliefs and concerns might promote intentions to get a COVID-19 vaccine. Method
  An online survey fielded between March 8-March 23, 2021 with US Veteran (n=688)
  and non-Veteran (n=387) respondents. In a between-subjects experiment, respondents
  were randomly assigned to a control group (with no message) or to read one of two
  intervention messages: 1. a fact-box styled message comparing the risks of getting
  COVID-19 compared to the vaccine, and 2. a timeline styled message describing the
  development process of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. Results Most respondents (60%)
  wanted a COVID-19 vaccine. However, 17% expressed hesitancy and 23% did not want
  to get a COVID-19 vaccine. The fact-box styled message and the timeline message
  did not significantly improve vaccination intentions, F(2,358)=0.86, p=.425, partial
  eta squared=.005, or reduce the time respondents wanted to wait before getting vaccinated,
  F(2,306)=0.79, p=.453, partial eta squared=.005, compared to no messages. Discussion
  We did not find an impact on vaccine intention based on providing information about
  vaccine risks and development. Further research is needed to identify how to effectively
  address concerns about the risks associated with COVID-19 vaccines and the development
  process and to understand additional factors that influence vaccine intentions.'
