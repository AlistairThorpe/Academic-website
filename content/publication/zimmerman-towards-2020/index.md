abstract: Loss of privacy and encounters with misinformation are two challenges individuals
  are likely to encounter in their search for information on the web. These challenges
  have potential negative impacts, especially in search domains such as health search.
  Existing information retrieval (IR) systems offer users little (if any) guidance
  as to how to reduce the likelihood of such negative impacts. The sum of these problems
  provides motivation for experiments to identify elements of existing IR environments
  that might provide low-cost options to the user for improved search outcomes. An
  online user study (N = 90) was performed allowing users to visit search results
  for 10 medical search tasks adapted from previous research. Analysis was performed
  on all search results visited in the experiment, with a total of 523 unique web
  pages collectively visited, with additional analysis performed on a set of 10,000
  popular websites. The analysis suggests that the best strategy for users with the
  goal of protecting their privacy and simultaneously finding more accurate information
  for their medical search tasks, is to visit websites with .org and .gov in the URL.
  There is some evidence that HTTP is a useful predictor as well. Existing literature
  is limited with respect to utilization of these features and thus the findings,
  along with the annotations, are a key contribution for future research, for which
  possible directions are provided.
