abstract: 'Clinical guidelines recommend that physicians educate patients about illnesses
  and antibiotics to eliminate inappropriate preferences for antibiotics. We expected
  that information provision about illnesses and antibiotics would reduce but not
  eliminate inappropriate preferences for antibiotics and that cognitive biases could
  explain why some people resist the effect of information provision. In 2 experiments,
  participants (n₁ = 424; n₂ = 434) either received incomplete information (about
  the viral etiology of their infection) or complete information (about viral etiology
  and the ineffectiveness and harms of taking antibiotics), before deciding to rest
  or take antibiotics. Those in the complete information conditions responded to items
  on 4 biases: action bias, social norm, source discrediting, and information neglect.
  In 2 follow-up experiments (n₁ = 150; n₂ = 732), we aimed to counteract the action
  bias by reframing the perception of the resting option as an action. Complete information
  provision reduced but did not eliminate inappropriate preferences for antibiotics.
  Around 10% of people wanted antibiotics even when informed they are harmful and
  offer no benefit and even when the alternative option (i.e., rest) was framed as
  an active treatment option. Results suggest an action bias underpins this preference
  but appears challenging to counteract. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all
