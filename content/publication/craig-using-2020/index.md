abstract: This paper explores the nature and impact of research misconduct in psychology
  by analyzing 160 articles that were retracted from prominent scholarly journals
  between 1998 and 2017. We compare findings with recent studies of retracted papers
  in economics, and business and management, to profile practices that are likely
  to be problematic in cognate social science disciplines. In psychology, the principal
  reason for retraction was data fabrication. Retractions took longer to make, and
  generally were from higher ranked and more prestigious journals, than in the two
  cognate disciplines. We recommend that journal editors should be more forthcoming
  in the reasons they provide for article retractions. We also recommend that the
  discipline of psychology gives a greater priority to the publication of replication
  studies; initiates a debate about how to respond to failed replications; adopts
  a more critical attitude to the importance of attaining statistical significance;
  discourages p-hacking and Hypothesizing After Results are Known (HARKing); assesses
  the long-term effects of pre-registering research; and supports stronger procedures
  to attest to the authenticity of data in research papers. Our contribution locates
  these issues in the context of a growing crisis of confidence in the value of social
  science research. We also challenge individual researchers to reassert the primacy
  of disinterested academic inquiry above pressures that can lead to an erosion of
  scholarly integrity.
