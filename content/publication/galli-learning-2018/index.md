abstract: 'Background/study context: Recent studies have shown that young adults better
  remember factual information they are curious about. It is not entirely clear, however,
  whether this eﬀect is retained during aging. Here, the authors investigated curiosity-driven
  memory beneﬁts in young and elderly individuals. Methods: In two experiments, young
  (age range 18–26) and older (age range 65–89) adults read trivia questions and rated
  their curiosity to ﬁnd out the answer. They also attended to task-irrelevant faces
  presented between the trivia question and the answer. The authors then administered
  a surprise memory test to assess recall accuracy for trivia answers and recognition
  memory performance for the incidentally learned faces. Results: In both young and
  elderly adults, recall performance was higher for answers to questions that elicited
  high levels of curiosity. In Experiment 1, the authors also found that faces presented
  in temporal proximity to curiosity-eliciting trivia questions were better recognized,
  indicating that the beneﬁcial eﬀects of curiosity extended to the encoding of task-irrelevant
  material. Conclusions: These ﬁndings show that elderly individuals beneﬁt from the
  memory-enhancing eﬀects of curiosity. This may lead to the implementation of learning
  strategies that target and stimulate curiosity in aging.'
