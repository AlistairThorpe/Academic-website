I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Utah, School of Medicine working with Drs. Angela Fagerlin and Elissa Ozanne in the Department of Population Health Sciences. 

I have general research interest in understanding how people estimate, judge, and make health-related decisions. Based on these insights, I aim to develop interventions (e.g., decision aids and communication strategies) designed to engender more judicious decisions about health and wellbeing.
